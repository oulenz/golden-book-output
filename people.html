Educated at Sewanee (where he was an honour man in his class) and Oxford, England (as a Rhodes Scholar, where he became a good tennis player). In Europe between December 1917 and April 1919 as part of the YMCA. Learned the art of glass blowing in Venice which he continued to practice after returning home. Married Belle Mitchell in early 1920, with whom he had already maintained an affair since 1917, and with whom and whose daughter he moved to Kinston, first into a rented house, then 1922 into a bungalow he built for them. Also briefly in an affair with Belle&rsquo;s sister Joan Heppleton in December 1919. Mortgaged his Kinston house so that he could keep the family home in Jefferson and his sister would not need to rent it out.</p>
<p>Temporarily left Belle sometime in 1924&ndash;25, then stayed with her until he again decided to quit her on 3 May 1929, because he felt the dripping of the package of shrimps (whose smell even after ten years he couldn&rsquo;t stand) he collected from the station for Belle every Friday summed up his existence. On his way to his sister, forced to spend the evening of 7 May at the Old Frenchman Place, following a chance encounter with Popeye. After Popeye&rsquo;s murder of Tommy and rape of Temple Drake, and against the express wish of his sister, provided a measure of accomodation for Ruby Goodwin and her infant son and unsuccessfully acted as defence attorney for her common law husband Lee Goodwin, who on 21 June was convicted for Popeye&rsquo;s crimes and subsequently lynched.

<p>In September of that year, started reading law at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where he met his half-brother Henry Sutpen, who, unaware of their being related, invited him to Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred over Christmas and introduced him to their sister Judith Sutpen. Over the course of the following year, 1860, entered into an undefined and never-spoken second engagement with Judith, engineered by her mother Ellen. Refused to explicitly make a proposal of marriage not because he suspected Judith was his half-sister, but because he was more interested in receiving a sign &mdash; any sign &mdash; by his father that he recognised him.

In New Orleans, explained to Henry that he would only break off the engagement if his father would confront himself.</p>
<p>Hoping that the war would resolve the matter by killing either of them, in the spring of 1861 they returned north, into Mississippi and secretely enrolled as privates in the University Grays Company of the 11th Mississippi Infantry, hiding until they could join the company after its departure in June. Received a lieutenancy before the company entered its first engagement even. In April 1862, either he or Henry was shot through the shoulder during the battle of Shiloh at Pittsburg Landing, carried to safety by the other on his shoulders, and recovered in a private house in Corinth.</p>
<p>During those four years, suspended his decision and did not contact Judith. Then finally, in March 1865, while retreating through Carolina, crossed paths with Thomas Sutpen and believed to see recognition in his gaze, and wrote a letter to Judith. Initially met acquiescence with Henry, then renewed refusal after Henry was told by his father that he was of mixed race descent. Henry still refused to stop him with force, until finally on 3 May 1865, Henry shot him dead at the gates of Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred upon their return from the war.</p>

<p>In July 1927, set fire to the shed at Gillespie&rsquo;s in a failed attempt to destroy the coffin holding the rotting corpse of his mother, stored there for the night en route to her burial in Jefferson. Sent to the mental asylum in Jackson by his father to avoid a claim by Mr Gillespie.</p>-->

Half-brother of Cash, Darl, Dewey Dell and Vardaman Bundren. A head taller than any of the rest of his family. According to Cora Tull, his mother always whipped him and petted him more than his brothers, while he flung into tantrums or sulking spells, inventing devilment to devil his mother, and he grew up to be a Bundren through and through, loving nobody, caring for nothing except how to get something with the least amount of work, always doing something that made him some money or got him talked about.</p>
<p>When he was fifteen, spent all of June to November single-handedly cleaning up forty acres of land for Lon (I) Quick, working at night by lantern and suffering from narcolepsy by day, which led to a dereliction of his domestic duties and aroused suspicion of illness in his mother, lazyness in his father and an affair with a married woman in his elder brothers.

                <dd><p>Born c 1800, Tennessee, died 1864, Jefferson. Brother of Miss Coldfield, husband of Mrs Coldfield, father of Ellen Coldfield Sutpen and Rosa Coldfield.</p>
<p>Married Mrs Coldfield, became father of Ellen in 1817. Moved with his family (including his sister and mother) to Jefferson in 1828, established a small mercantile business. Methodist steward. Neither drank nor hunted nor gambled. Owned neither land nor slaves except two female house servants who came into his possession through a debt and whom he freed as soon as he got them, bought them, putting them on a weekly wage which he held back in full against the discharge of the current market value at which he had assumed them on the debt.</p>
<p>In April 1838, betrothed his daughter Ellen to Thomas Sutpen, apparently moved by his hundred miles of plantation (Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred).</p>
<p>In 1845 his wife gave birth to their daughter Rosa and died in labour.</p>
<p>Opposed the civil war as a conscientious objector on religious grounds. Closed his store and kept it closed all during the period that soldiers were being mobilised and drilled, refused to sell any goods for any price not only to the military but, so it was told, to the families not only of soldiers but of men or women who had supported secession and war only in talk, opinion. Refused to permit his sister to come back home to live while her horse-trader husband was in the army. His two house servants were among the first Jefferson negroes to desert and follow the Yankee troops.</p>
<p>Eventually closed his store permanently. Lived with his daughter Rosa in the back of the house, with the front door locked and the front shutters closed and fastened, and where, so the neighbours said, he spent the day behind one of the slightly opened blinds like a picquet on post, armed not with a musket but with the big family bible  until a detachment of troops would pass: whereupon he would open the bible and declaim in a harsh loud voice even above the sound of the tramping feet, the passages of the old violent vindictive mysticism which he had already marked as the actual picquet would have ranged his row of cartridges along the window sill. Then one morning in 1861 he learned that his store had been broken into and looted, doubtless by a company of strange troops bivouacked on the edge of town and doubtless abetted, if only vocally, by his own fellow citizens. That night he mounted to the attic with his hammer and his handful of nails and nailed the door behind him and threw the hammer out the window. He was not a coward. He was a man of uncompromising moral strength. He was not a coward, even though his consciousness may have objected  not so much to the idea of pouring out human blood and life, but at the idea of waste: of wearing out and eating up and shooting away material in any cause whatever.</p>
<p>Fed by his daughter, who hauled up food at night by means of a well pulley and rope attached to the attic window. Then he died. One morning his hand did not come out to draw up the basket. When his daughter with the help of neighbours broke open the door, they found him  with three days&rsquo; uneaten food beside his pallet bed.</p>
<p>Left neither will nor estate except the house and the rifled shell of the store. So Judge Benbow appointed himself as executor of his estate, assuming responsibility for his daughter Rosa&rsquo;s finances.</p></dd>

                <dd><p>Born 1845, Jefferson, died 8 January 1910. Daughter of Goodhue and Mrs Coldfield, sister of Ellen Coldfield Sutpen. Born very late into her parents&rsquo; marriage, her mother dying in labour, for which she never forgave her father. Raised by her spinster aunt Miss Coldfield. had never been taught to do anything practical because the aunt had raised her to believe that she was not only delicate but actually precious</p>
<p>After her father&rsquo;s store was looted, he bolted himself shut in the attic. Now her life consisted of keeping it in herself and her father. She  was cooking the food which as time passed became harder and harder to come by and poorer and poorer in quality, and hauling it up to her father at night by means of a well pully and rope attached to the attic window. She did this for three years, feeding in secret and at night and with food which in quantity was scarcely sufficient for one.</p>
<p>Moved to Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred in June 1865, following the death of her sister and her father, for food and shelter and to fulfil her sister&rsquo;s dying wish that she should look after her (four years elder) niece Judith Sutpen. Became engaged to Thomas Sutpen in April 1866 but broke off the engagement and moved back to her family home in Jefferson in June, after he proposed they conceive a child and only marry if it were a boy. Wore only black thereafter, and nothing under the sun, certainly no man nor committee of men, would ever persuade her to go back to her niece and brother-in-law.</p>
<p>Now Judge Benbow and a group of fellow citizens and neighbors left baskets of food on her doorstep at night, the dishes (the plates containing the food, the napkins which covered it) from which she never washed but returned soiled to the empty basket and set the basket back on the same step where she had found it as if to carry completely out the illusion that it had never existed or at least that she had never touched, emptied, it, had not come out and taken the basket up with that air which had nothing whatever of furtiveness in it nor even defiance, who doubtless tasted the food, criticised its quality or cooking, chewed and swallowed it and felt it digest yet still clung to that delusion, that calm incorrigible insistence that that which all incontrovertible evidence tells her is so does not exist, as women can.</p>
<p>Judge Benbow had appointed himself executor of her father&rsquo;s estate, but that same self deluding  declined to admit that the liquidation of the store had left her something, that she had been left anything but a complete pauper, who would not accept the actual money from the sale of the store from Judge Benbow yet would accept the money&rsquo;s value (and after a few years, over-value) in a dozen ways: would use casual negro boys who happened to pass the house, stopping them and commanding them to rake her yard and they doubtless as aware as the town was that there would be no mention of pay from her, that they would not even see her again though they knew she was watching them from behind the curtains of a window, but that Judge Benbow would pay them &mdash; would enter the stores and command objects from the shelves and showcases  and walk out of the store with them &mdash; who with the same aberrant cunning which would not wash the dishes and napkins from the baskets declined to have any discussion of her affairs with Benbow since she must have known that the sums which she had received from him must have years ago over-balanced  whatever the store had brought.</p>
<p>Already in the first year of her father&rsquo;s voluntary incarceration,  dated at two oclock in the morning, she had written the first of her odes to Southern soldiers. After the war, she established herself as the town&rsquo;s and the county&rsquo;s poetess laureate by issuing to the stern and meager subscription list of the county newspaper poems, ode, eulogy, and epitaph, out of some bitter and implacable reserve of undefeat. By 1885, her portfolio contained a thousand or more pieces.</p>
<p>After her niece Judith Sutpen died in 1884, she commanded a two hundred dollar headstone from Judge Benbow.</p>
<p>Refused at the last to be a ghost. Visited Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred in September 1909 with Quentin (III) Compson to find that Henry had returned and was hiding there. Returned with an ambulance around Christmas, upon which Clytemnestra set fire to the house, killing herself and Henry. Had to be transported back in the ambulance herself, subsequently entering a coma. Died almost two weeks later, 8 January 1910. Buried the next day.</p></dd>

                <dd><p><em>Caddy</em>. Born 1891&ndash;92, died after 1943. Second-oldest child of Jason (III) and Caroline Compson, mother of Quentin (IV). Doomed and knew it, accepted the doom without either seeking or fleeing it. Loved her brother Quentin (III) despite him, loved not only him but loved in him that bitter prophet and inflexible corruptless judge of what he considered the family &lsquo;s honor and its doom, as he thought he loved but really hated in her what he considered the frail doomed vessel of its pride and the foul instrument of its disgrace, not only this, she loved him not only in spite of but because of the fact that he himself was incapable of love, accepting the fact that he must value above all not her but the virginity of which she was custodian and on which she placed no value whatever: the frail physical stricture which to her was no more than a hangnail would have been. Knew the brother loved death best of all and was not jealous, would (and perhaps in the calculation and deliberation of her marriage did) have handed him the hypothetical hemlock.</p>
<p>Had several boyfriends, including Dalton Ames, who may have been the father of Quentin (IV), which regardless of what its sex would be she had already named after the brother whom they both (she and her brother) knew was already the same as dead. Married Sydney Herbert Head on 25 April 1910, whom she and her mother had met while vacationing at French Lick the summer before and who gifted her the first car in Jefferson. Already two months pregnant of Quentin (IV) at that point and therefore felt she got to marry someone. Divorced by Herbert Head in 1911, likely because he discovered Quentin (IV) was not his. Entrusted her into the care of her mother and her brother Jason Compson (IV), and departed by the next train. Sent money to Jason (IV) each month for her daughter&rsquo;s upbringing, who kept it for himself and who generally prevented her from seeing Quentin (IV) again. Seemingly prostituted herself for some time. Not invited to her father&rsquo;s funeral, but attended it incognito after reading about it in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Remarried 1920 to a minor movingpicture magnate, Hollywood California. Divorced by mutual agreement, Mexico 1925. Vanished in Paris with the German occupation, 1940, still beautiful and probably still wealthy too since she did not look within fifteen years of her actual fortyeight, whereafter she was not seen or heard of again, except by her high school class mate Melissa Meek, who in 1943 recognised her in a picture, a photograph in color clipped obviously from a slick magazine—a picture filled with luxury and money and sunlight—a Cannebière backdrop of mountains and palms and cypresses and the sea, an open powerful expensive chromium/rimmed sports car, the woman&rsquo;s face hatless between a rich scarf and a seal coat, ageless and beautiful, cold serene and damned; beside her a handsome lean man of middleage in the ribbons and tabs of a German staffgeneral.</p></dd>

Already two months pregnant of Quentin (IV) at that point and therefore felt she got to marry someone. Divorced by Herbert Head in 1911, likely because he discovered Quentin (IV) was not his. Entrusted her into the care of her mother and her brother Jason Compson (IV), and departed by the next train. Sent money to Jason (IV) each month for her daughter&rsquo;s upbringing, who kept it for himself and who generally prevented her from seeing Quentin (IV) again. Seemingly prostituted herself for some time. Not invited to her father&rsquo;s funeral, but attended it incognito after reading about it in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Remarried 1920 to a minor movingpicture magnate, Hollywood California. Divorced by mutual agreement, Mexico 1925. Vanished in Paris with the German occupation, 1940, still beautiful and probably still wealthy too since she did not look within fifteen years of her actual fortyeight, whereafter she was not seen or heard of again, except by her high school class mate Melissa Meek, who in 1943 recognised her in a picture, a photograph in color clipped obviously from a slick magazine—a picture filled with luxury and money and sunlight—a Cannebière backdrop of mountains and palms and cypresses and the sea, an open powerful expensive chromium/rimmed sports car, the woman&rsquo;s face hatless between a rich scarf and a seal coat, ageless and beautiful, cold serene and damned; beside her a handsome lean man of middleage in the ribbons and tabs of a German staffgeneral.</p>-->

                <dd><p>Born 1892&ndash;94. Youngest-but-one son of Jason (III) and Caroline Compson.</p>
<p>After his parents had sold off part of the Compson place to pay for his sister Candace&rsquo;s (failed) marriage to Sydney Head and his brother Quentin (III)&rsquo;s first year at Harvard (which ended in suicide), used his own niggard savings out of his meagre wages as a storeclerk to send himself to a Memphis school where he learned to class and grade cotton. Started working in Earl Triplett&rsquo;s farmers&rsquo; supply store in Jefferson in 1916. Begrudged Candace and her daughter Quentin (IV) missing out on a position at Sydney Head&rsquo;s bank that he had been promised, since Sydney Head probably divorced Candace because he discovered Quentin (IV) was not his. Kept for himself the 200 dollar sent each month by Candace for her daughter Quentin (IV), replacing the cheque with a fake one for their mother to burn, and banking the real cheques as his salary on his mother&rsquo;s account, whom they were made out to and over whom he had power of attorney. His actual salary may have been 160 dollar a month. Used the 1000 dollar his mother invested for him in Earl Triplett&rsquo;s business to buy himself a car. Had regular headaches, which his mother believed were caused by the gasoline of the car.</p>
<p>The first sane Compson since before Culloden and (a childless bachelor) hence the last. Logical rational contained and even a philosopher in the old stoic tradition: thinking nothing whatever of God one way or the other and simply considering the police and so fearing and respecting only the Negro woman, his sworn enemy since his birth and his mortal one since that day in 1911 when she Dilsey Gibson too divined by simple clairvoyance that he was somehow using his infant niece Quentin IV&rsquo;s illegitimacy to blackmail its mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Following his dipsomaniac father&rsquo;s death, he assumed the entire burden of the rotting family in the rotting house, supporting his idiot brother Maury Compson because of their mother, sacrificing what pleasures might have been the right and just due and even the necessity of a thirty-year-old bachelor, so that his mother&rsquo;s life might continue as nearly as possible to what it had been this not because he loved her but (a sane man always) simply because he was afraid of the Negro cook Dilsey Gibson whom he could not even force to leave even when he tried to stop paying her weekly wages.</p>
<p>After his brother Maury touched a passing schoolgirl outside the fence delimiting the Compson Place, had himself appointed the idiot&rsquo;s guardian without letting their mother know and had it castrated before their mother even knew it was out of the house.</p>
<p>Not only fended off end held his own with Compsons but competed and held his own with the Snopeses who took over the little town Jefferson following the turn of the century as the Compsons and Sartorises and their ilk faded from it. Managed to save almost three thousand dollars ($2840.50)  in niggard and agonised dimes and quarters and halfdollars, which hoard he kept in no bank because to him a banker too was just one more Compson, but hid in a locked bureau drawer in his bedroom whose bed he made and changed himself since he kept the bedroom door locked all the time save when he was passing through it. To him all the rest of the town and the world and the human race too except himself were Compsons, inexplicable yet quite predictable in that they were in no sense whatever to be trusted.</p>
<p>On 7 April 1928, his niece Quentin (IV) broke into his room through the window and took off with his savings. He unsuccessfully pursued her to Mottson. The amount she stole was not $2840.50, it was almost seven thousand dollars and this was Jason&rsquo;s rage, the red unbearable fury which on that night and at intervals recurring with little or no diminishment for the next five years, made him seriously believe would at some unwarned instant destroy him, kill him as instantaneously dead as a bullet or a lightningbolt: that although he had been robbed not of a mere petty three thousand dollars but of almost seven thousand he couldn&rsquo;t even tell anybody; because he had been robbed of seven thousand dollars instead of just three he could not only never receive justification &mdash; he did not want sympathy &mdash; from other men unlucky enough to have one bitch for a sister and another for a niece, he couldn&rsquo;t even go to the police; because he had lost four thousand dollars which did not belong to him he couldn&rsquo;t even recover the three thousand which did since those first four thousand dollars were not only the legal property of his niece as a part of the money supplied for her support and maintenance by her mother over the last sixteen years, they did not exist at all, having been officially recorded as expended and consumed in the annual reports he submitted to the district Chancellor, as required of him as guardian and trustee by his bondsmen: so that he had been robbed not only of his thievings but his savings too, and by his own victim; he had been robbed not only of the four thousand dollars which he had risked jail to acquire but of the three thousand which he had hoarded at the price of sacrifice and denial, almost a nickel and a dime at a time, over a period of almost twenty years: and this not only by his own victim but by a child who did it at one blow, without premeditation or plan, not even knowing or even caring how much she would find when she broke the drawer open; and now he couldn&rsquo;t even go to the police for help: he who had considered the police always, never given them any trouble, had paid the taxes for years which supported them in parasitic and sadistic idleness; not only that, he didn&rsquo;t dare pursue the girl himself because he might catch her and she would talk, so that his only recourse was a vain dream which kept him tossing and sweating on nights two and three and even four years after the event, when he should have forgotten about it: of catching her without warning, springing on her out of the dark, before she had spent all the money, and murder her before she had time to open her mouth.</p>
<p>Probably between 1928 and 1933, he took over the farmers&rsquo; supply store from Earl Triplett.</p>
<p>After the death of his mother in 1933 he (no Snopes, but Jason Compson himself) committed his brother Maury to the state asylum in Jackson and vacated the Compson Place, first chopping up the vast oncesplendid rooms into what he called apartments and selling the whole thing to a countryman who opened a boardinghouse in it. Thus he was able to free himself forever not only from the idiot brother and the house but from the Negro woman too, moving into a pair of offices up a flight of stairs above the supplystore containing his cotton ledgers and samples, which he had converted into a bedroom-kitchen-bath, in and out of which on weekends there would be seen a big plain friendly brazenhaired pleasantfaced woman Lorraine no longer very young, in round picture hats and (in its season) an imitation fur coat, the two of them, the middleaged cottonbuyer and the woman whom the town called, simply, his friend from Memphis, seen at the local picture show on Saturday night and on Sunday morning mounting the apartment stairs with paper bags from the grocer&rsquo;s containing loaves and eggs and oranges and cans of soup, domestic, uxorious, connubial, until the late afternoon bus carried her back to Memphis. He was emancipated now. He was free. &lsquo;In 1865,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;Abe Lincoln freed the niggers from the Compsons. In 1933, Jason Compson freed the Compsons from the niggers.&rsquo;</p></dd>

The amount she stole was not $2840.50, it was almost seven thousand dollars and this was Jason&rsquo;s rage, the red unbearable fury which on that night and at intervals recurring with little or no diminishment for the next five years, made him seriously believe would at some unwarned instant destroy him, kill him as instantaneously dead as a bullet or a lightningbolt: that although he had been robbed not of a mere petty three thousand dollars but of almost seven thousand he couldn&rsquo;t even tell anybody; because he had been robbed of seven thousand dollars instead of just three he could not only never receive justification &mdash; he did not want sympathy &mdash; from other men unlucky enough to have one bitch for a sister and another for a niece, he couldn&rsquo;t even go to the police; because he had lost four thousand dollars which did not belong to him he couldn&rsquo;t even recover the three thousand which did since those first four thousand dollars were not only the legal property of his niece as a part of the money supplied for her support and maintenance by her mother over the last sixteen years, they did not exist at all, having been officially recorded as expended and consumed in the annual reports he submitted to the district Chancellor, as required of him as guardian and trustee by his bondsmen: so that he had been robbed not only of his thievings but his savings too, and by his own victim; he had been robbed not only of the four thousand dollars which he had risked jail to acquire but of the three thousand which he had hoarded at the price of sacrifice and denial, almost a nickel and a dime at a time, over a period of almost twenty years: and this not only by his own victim but by a child who did it at one blow, without premeditation or plan, not even knowing or even caring how much she would find when she broke the drawer open; and now he couldn&rsquo;t even go to the police for help: he who had considered the police always, never given them any trouble, had paid the taxes for years which supported them in parasitic and sadistic idleness; not only that, he didn&rsquo;t dare pursue the girl himself because he might catch her and she would talk, so that his only recourse was a vain dream which kept him tossing and sweating on nights two and three and even four years after the event, when he should have forgotten about it: of catching her without warning, springing on her out of the dark, before she had spent all the money, and murder her before she had time to open her mouth.</p>
<p>Probably between 1928 and 1933, he took over the farmers&rsquo; supply store from Earl Triplett.</p>
<p>After the death of his mother in 1933 he (no Snopes, but Jason Compson himself) committed his brother Maury to the state asylum in Jackson and vacated the Compson Place, first chopping up the vast oncesplendid rooms into what he called apartments and selling the whole thing to a countryman who opened a boardinghouse in it. Thus he was able to free himself forever not only from the idiot brother and the house but from the Negro woman too, moving into a pair of offices up a flight of stairs above the supplystore containing his cotton ledgers and samples, which he had converted into a bedroom-kitchen-bath, in and out of which on weekends there would be seen a big plain friendly brazenhaired pleasantfaced woman Lorraine no longer very young, in round picture hats and (in its season) an imitation fur coat, the two of them, the middleaged cottonbuyer and the woman whom the town called, simply, his friend from Memphis, seen at the local picture show on Saturday night and on Sunday morning mounting the apartment stairs with paper bags from the grocer&rsquo;s containing loaves and eggs and oranges and cans of soup, domestic, uxorious, connubial, until the late afternoon bus carried her back to Memphis. He was emancipated now. He was free. &lsquo;In 1865,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;Abe Lincoln freed the niggers from the Compsons. In 1933, Jason Compson freed the Compsons from the niggers.&rsquo;</p>-->

                <dd><p>Died 22 June 1929. Moonshiner, common law husband of Ruby Lamar and father of an unnamed boy. Entered a relationship with Ruby before 1915, when he went to the Philippines for a year to serve as a cavalry sergeant. In early 1916, five months before the end of his stay, killed a fellow soldier over a black woman. Sent to Leavenworth upon his return, where he was visited by Ruby every second Sunday, then to World War I France to fight with the infantry, earning two medals, then back to Leavenworth, until his lawyer got a congressman to get him free. Beat up Ruby upon finding out she had paid the lawyer through prostitution. Their plans of formal marriage were forestalled by a lack of funds. At some point (probably before 1915) also served on the Mexican border. Started moonshining at the Old Frenchman Place in 1925, accompanied by Ruby, his father, Tommy, Van and at some point, Memphis gangster Popeye. His and Ruby&rsquo;s son was born in 1928. Arrested for Popeye&rsquo;s murder of Tommy and rape of Temple Drake on 12 May 1929. Defended by Horace Benbow in the subsequent court case, but wrongfully convicted on 21 June after Temple Drake falsely identified him as the perpetrator, and lynched (for Temple&rsquo;s Drake rape, not for Tommy&rsquo;s murder) between 00:30 and 01:00 hrs in the following night, by being burned alive in a vacant lot in an alley next to the jail.</p></dd>

Entered her relationship with Goodwin before he went to the Philippines as a cavalry sergeant in 1915. A previous boyfriend (Frank) was shot by her father after refusing to stop seeing her. When Goodwin went to the Philippines, stayed behind in San Francisco, got a job and lived in a hall room, all the while staying faithful to him. When she found out about the return of his company, had to quit her job to meet him at the harbour, where she found out from another soldier that he had been imprisoned at Leavenworth. Had to get another job for two months to save enough money to join him at Leavenworth, where she lived in a single room for two years, cooking over a gasjet, and worked night shifts at Child&rsquo;s as a waitress so she could see him every other Sunday afternoon. Prostituted herself to a lawyer for two months before finding out that he couldn&rsquo;t do anything for Goodwin, him being a federal prisoner. When Goodwin was sent to fight in World War I France, moved to New York and worked in a munitions plant, &lsquo;staying straight&rsquo;, despite ample romantic opportunities both in the factory and from soldiers returning from the war. When Goodwin was again sent to Leavenworth after the war, prostituted herself to pay for a lawyer to get a congressman to get him released, for this beat up by him.

In 1863, Amadeus McCaslin had become a Sergeant in Tennant&rsquo;s brigade in Virginia.</p>-->

Following the death of their father, they moved into a two-room log house with about a dozen dogs, and let their slaves live in the manor of the McCaslin Place. According to John (I) Sartoris, the two were far ahead of their time, believing that land did not belong to people but that people belonged to land. They supposedly had a system of bookkeeping by which their slaves could earn their freedom through work on the plantation. Improved the position of many dirt farmers by convincing them to pool their plots with the plantation, who in turn looked upon them like God.</p>
<p>Upon the outbreak of the civil war, the brothers wanted to join John (I) Sartoris&rsquo;s regiment, but were refused due to their old age. Backed by the dirt farmer constituency, they first threatened to start a separate regiment, then to have John (I) Sartoris demoted by popular election, before the compromise was reached that one brother could join the regiment, to be decided by three hands of draw poker.

<p>After Rosa Millard&rsquo;s betrayal by Ab Snopes and murder by Grumby in December 1864, he accompanied Bayard (II) Sartoris and Marengo Strother in their pursuit first of Snopes, and then of Grumby&rsquo;s group of bandits. By Christmas, the rheumatism in his right arm was so bad that he couldn&rsquo;t hardly lift his hand. In late January or early February, they encountered gang member Matt Bowden, posing as a Tennessee slave owner, who shot McCaslin in the same right arm. The following day, they found Ab Snopes tied to a tree, left behind by the bandits for them to find, and the day after that, McCaslin, who had fallen ill due to his arm, went back to Jefferson with Snopes.</p></dd>

He arranged for General Andrew Jackson Smith to sign on 14 August 1863 a requisition order for 110 mules, 110 negroes, ten chests and provisions.

She rekindled local church life together with Mr Fortinbride (who acted as Minister) and to its members she distributed in a meticulously controlled manner the provisions, the proceeds from the sales and the mules that they could not sell because they had been branded. In December 1864, after they couldn&rsquo;t requisition any more mules because word of the scheme had spread, because she had been forced to reveal her real name and because Federate troops were withdrawing from the region anyway, and after one such withdrawing regiment, alerted by Ab Snopes as to where she lived, had confiscated their remaining 60 odd mules, she let herself be talked into a plan by Ab Snopes to try to requisition the four horses of the group of bandits known as Grumby&rsquo;s independents with a forged order from General Forrest, so as to have a starting capital of 1500 dollars for John Sartoris (I) to rebuild their plantation with.

<p>Practiced medicine in Yoknapatawpha county when a doctor’s equipment consisted of a saw and a gallon of whisky and a satchel of calomel; he had been John (I) Sartoris’ regimental surgeon, and up to the day of the automobile he would start out at any hour of the twenty-four in any weather and for any distance, over practically impassable roads in a lopsided buckboard to visit anyone, white or black, who sent for him. Never worried a fellow before he was ready to pay; accepting for fee usually a meal of corn pone and coffee or perhaps a small measure of corn or fruit, or a few flower bulbs or graftings. When he was young and hasty he had kept a daybook, kept it meticulously until these hypothetical assets totalled $10,000.00. But that was in 1880, and since then he hadn’t bothered with a record at all; and later from time to time a countryman entered his shabby office and discharged an obligation, commemorating sometimes the payor’s entry into the world, incurred by his father or grandfather and which Dr Peabody himself had long since forgotten about. Every one in the county knew him and sent him hams and wild game at Christmas, and it was said that he could spend the balance of his days driving about the county in the buckboard he still used, with never a thought for board and lodging and without the expenditure of a penny for either.</p>
<p>Starting after the Civil War, partook in Thanksgiving and Christmas meals at the Sartoris Place. Claimed to have proposed to Virginia du Pre in the Sartoris garden in the spring of 1969, on John (I) Sartoris’ account because he was having more trouble than he could stand with politics outside his home, and pretty near had her persuaded for a while.</p>
<p>Courted his eventual wife for fourteen years before he was able to marry her. The courtship was during the days when he physicked and amputated the whole county by buckboard; often after a year’s separation he would drive forty miles to see her, to be intercepted on the way and deflected to a childbed or a mangled limb, with only a scribbled message to assuage the interval of another year. Their only child was born in 1890.</p>
<p>Amputated the leg of Mr Suratt.</p>
<p>By 1919, had six or seven black servants, and more unregistered ones. His library consisted of a stack of lurid paper covered nickel novels, slowly gathering successive layers of dust, and he passed his office hours on the sofa, reading them over and over.</p>
<p>Was still traversing the county to visit patients in 1927, attending to Addie Bundren as she lay dying. Reckoned he must reach the fifty-thousand dollar mark of dead accounts on his books before he could quit.</p></dd>

                <dd><p>Born September 1849, died c 18 December 1919. Son and middle child of John Sartoris (I) and Mrs Sartoris, brother of Miss Sartoris (I) and Miss Sartoris (II). Father of John Sartoris (II). Born in the same month as Marengo Strother, fed at the same breast (&hellip;) slept together and eaten together. Hunted possom together during Indian Summer nights. And together they shot dead with the family musket the best horse of a Federate troop that passed the Sartoris Place in July 1862. After another regiment burned down the Sartoris Place he traveled with his grandmother Rosa Millard, Marengo Strother and Joby Strother to Alabama in June 1863 to ask for compensation from Colonel Nathaniel Dick, who arranged for a requisition order signed by General Smith for 110 mules, 110 negroes, ten chests and provisions. In the following period, until October 1864, he helped his grandmother with the scheme to acquire 138 more mules through additional, forged requisition orders. After her betrayal by Ab Snopes and murder by Grumby in December 1864, he, Marengo Strother and (initially) Theophilus McCaslin pursued Grumby&rsquo;s group of bandits for over two months. In late February 1865, they were confronted by the bandits, who handed over Grumby with a pistol to settle the matter. After Bayard Sartoris shot him dead, they took his body back to the abandoned cotton compress where he had killed Rosa Millard and nailed it to the door, and brought his hand to her grave in Jefferson. Studied Law in Oxford, lived with Mr Wilkins from 1870 until at least 1873. Enthralled by his father&rsquo;s second wife Drusilla, and the odour of the verbena she would wear. After his father was killed by Ben J Redmond, Bayard confronted him in his office, but refusing to draw his weapon. Redmond fired twice but missed, and then left Jefferson. First Sartoris to reach beyond the age of sixty. Developed a malignant growth on his cheek, which in 1919 was diagnosed as cancer by Dr Alford when at last he consulted him at the insistance of Virginia du Pre. Died in a light car accident a week before Christmas 1919, presumably of heart failure, when his grandson Bayard (III) lost control on the icy road. His last two horses were called Roosevelt and Taft.</p></dd>

<p>After another troop had burned down the Sartoris place, confiscated their two mules and taken the family silver, he, Bayard Sartoris and Joby Strother accompanied Rosa Millard to Alabama in June 1863 where they obtained a requisition order from General Andrew Jackason Smith for 110 mules, 110 negroes, ten chests and provisions.

<p>In his youth, his entire cosmopolitan experience  consisted probably of one or two trips to Memphis with his father to buy live stock or slaves, of sojourns at other houses, plantations, almost interchangeable with his own, where he followed the same routine which he did at home &mdash; the same hunting and cockfighting, the same amateur racing of horses on crude homemade tracks, horses sound enough in blood and lineage yet not bred to race and perhaps not even thirty minutes out of the shafts of a trap or perhaps even a carriage; the same square dancing with identical and also interchangeable provincial virgins, to music exactly like that at home, the same champagne, the best doubtless yet crudely dispensed out of the burlesqued pantomime elegance of negro butlers who (and likewise the drinkers who gulped it down like neat whiskey between flowery and unsubtle toasts) would have treated lemonade the same way.</p>
<p>In 1859, Started attending the University of Mississippi in Oxford. Fell under the spell of Charles (I) Bon, imitating his dress and speech and switching to law mid-term. Invited Charles home to Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred that Christmas and introduced him to his sister Judith, not knowing that he was their half-brother. Repudiated his birthright when on Christmas eve 1860, their father Thomas Sutpen forbade an engagement between Charles and Judith, revealing Charles&rsquo;s identity.

Confronted Charles, who refused to renounce the engagement until their father confronted himself.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1861 they returned north, into Mississippi, secretely enrolled as privates in the University Grays Company of the 11th Mississippi Infantry and hid, and only joined the company after it departed in June. In April 1862, either he or Charles was shot through the shoulder during the battle of Shiloh at Pittsburg Landing, carried to safety by the other on his shoulders, and recovered in a private house in Corinth, apparently for the sole purpose of being watched for two years more.

                <dd><p>Born 3 October 1841, Sutpen’s Hundred, died 12 February 1884, Sutpen’s Hundred. Daughter of Thomas and Ellen Coldfield Sutpen. In her childhood, slept in the same room as her elder half-sister Clytemnestra, often coming down to her pallet, and at least on one occasion letting her sleep in her bed. Had with her brother Henry a relationship closer than the traditional loyalty of brother and sister even; a curious relationship: something of that fierce impersonal rivalry between two cadets in a crack regiment who eat from the same dish and sleep under the same blanket and chance the same destruction and who would risk death for one another not for the other&rsquo;s sake but for the sake of the unbroken front of the regiment itself.</p>
<p>At Christmas 1859, was introduced to her brother&rsquo;s friend Charles (I) Bon, unaware that he was their half-brother from her father&rsquo;s first marriage. Over the course of the following year, entered into an undefined and never-spoken engagement with Charles, engineered by her mother. This engagement was forbidden the following Christmas Eve by their father Thomas Sutpen, who had traveled to New Orleans and confirmed his identity.</p>
<p>Save for a single letter in March 1865, had no more contact with Charles as he and Henry left to fight in the Civil War and Henry killed Charles upon their return in May 1865.</p>
<p>After her father&rsquo;s death in August 1869, buried him in the graveyard of Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred. Continued his crossroads store until, in 1870, she managed to sell it with the help of Jason Lycurgus Compson (II), using the proceeds to buy a headstone for Charles. In December 1871, sent her half-sister Clytemnestra to New Orleans to fetch Charles&rsquo;s son Charles (II) Etienne Saint-Valery Bon, and made a down payment of 100 dollar to Jason (II) Lycurgus Compson for a future headstone for him.</p>
<p>In January 1884 took Charles (II) into the main house at Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred to nurse his Yellow Fewer. Contracted the disease herself and died before him.</p>
<p>Suffered the Indignities and Travails of this World for 42 Years, 4 Months, 9 Days.</p>

                <dd><p>Born 1807, West Virginia mountains, died 12 August 1869, Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred. Husband first of Eulalia and later of Ellen Coldfield. Father of Charles Bon (with Eulalia), Clytemnestra (with an unnamed slave), Henry and Judith (with Ellen) and an unnamed girl (with Milly Jones).</p>
<p>Born into a large Methodist family of poor white Scotch-English stock. His mother was a mountain woman, a Scottish woman who .. never did quite learn to speak English.</p>
<p>In 1817, at the age of ten, over the course of perhaps a year, moved with his family down into Tidewater Virginia. Learned the difference not only between white men and black ones, but he was learning that there was a difference between white men and white men not to be measured by lifting anvils or gouging eyes or how much whiskey you could drink then get up and walk out of the room.</p>
<p>At thirteen or fourteen, sent by his father to a one-room country school for about three months one winter, in a room full of children three or four years younger than he and three or four years further advanced. Had not learned to read his own name at the end of the Winter.</p>
<p>Ran away from home in 1820, at fourteen, after being told by a slave to only approach the house of a plantation owner at the back entrance, leaving him unable to fulfill his errant. This set in motion a train of thought culminating in his becoming aware of and thereby losing his innocence, and the realisation that to combat all the human puny mortals under the sun that might lie in hammocks all afternoon with their shoes off, you got to have land and niggers and a fine house to combat them with. Set about for the rest of his life to fulfil this design.</p>
<p>Subsequently embarked as a sailor to the West Indies, to which he had learned in school poor men went in ships and became rich, it didn&rsquo;t matter how, so long as that man was clever and courageous. In the course of the following six years, settled on Haiti, where high mortality was concomitant with the money and the sheen on the dollars was not from gold but from blood, and where he became overseer or foreman or something to a French sugar planter and learned Patois and French.</p>
<p>In 1826 or 1827, broke an eight-day siege of the plantation house by the plantation&rsquo;s slaves when the house ran out of water on the eighth night, but was severely injured in the process. Not able to bear sugar since due to the rank sweet rich smell of the burning fields. Married the planter&rsquo;s daughter Eulalia in 1827, after he had recovered. A virgin until that time. Renounced her and their son, when, upon his birth in 1831, he found out that she had negro blood. Nonetheless chose both a first and a last name for him: Charles Bon.</p>
<p>Seeking some place to hide himself, came to Jefferson on a Sunday in June of 1833, bringing with him twenty to thirty male Caribbean slaves and a captive Parisian architect. Sought the guarantee of reputable men to barricade him from the other and later strangers who might come seeking him in turn, and Jefferson gave him that. In July 1833 contributed the labour of his slaves to the construction of Jefferson&rsquo;s improvised first courthouse.</p>
<p>Initially penniless, obtained money from an unknown source and took land from the Chickasaw nobody knows how, establishing the plantation of Sutpen’s Hundred. Jason Lycurgus Compson (II) lent him the seeds with which he started his plantation, and he became the nearest thing to a friend he ever had in Yoknapatawpha County and this friendship may have helped him to gain a foothold.</p>
<p>Spent the first two years building a big house following the design of his architect. In the Summer of 1834, when they had finished all the brick and had the foundations laid and most of the big timbers cut and trimmed, the architect made one unsuccessful attempt to escape into the river bottom, disappearing in broad daylight.  Led a search party in his pursuit that consisted of his slaves, dogs and a number of neighbours including Jason (II) Lycurgus Compson. Ran down the architect in the late afternoon of the third day, more than thirteen miles from the house.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1834, also let the architect oversee the construction of Jefferson&rsquo;s town square, new courthouse and refurbished jail. Became father of Clytemnestra with a slave in 1834. In 1835, his residence was completed save for the windowglass and the ironware which they could not make by hand, and he paid some compensation to the architect and let him leave.</p>
<p>Then he needed respectability, the shield of a virtuous woman, to make his position impregnable even against the men who had given him protection,  and it was Goodhue Coldfield who gave him that. Married his daughter Ellen Coldfield in June 1838. She came not from one of the local ducal houses but from the lesser baronage whose principality was so far decayed that there would be no risk of his wife bringing him for dowry delusions of grandeur before he should be equipped for it yet not so far decayed but that she might keep them both from getting lost among the new knives and forks and spoons that he had bought Became father of a son Henry with her in 1839 and of a daughter Judith in 1841.</p>
<p>Still invited parties of men for hunting, playing cards, drinking and organised fights between his slaves, in which he himself would occasionally participate at the end of an evening.</p>
<p>By 1848, had got his plantation to running smoothly and had employed as his overseer the son of the same sheriff who had arrested him  on the day of his betrothal. By the time of the Civil War, had become the biggest single landowner and cotton-planter in the county, through a singleminded unflagging effort and utter disregard of for his actions which the town could see might look and how the indicated one&rsquo;s which the town could not see must appear to it. He was not liked (which he evidently did not want anyway) but feared, which seemed to amuse, if not actually please, him.</p>
<p>At Christmas 1859, his son Henry brought home Charles, whom he had become friends with at university, and introduced Judith to Charles, unaware that he was their half-brother. As they entered into an undefined and never-spoken engagement engineered by their mother, he went to New Orleans in June to confirm Charles&rsquo;s identity. At Christmas, he confronted Henry about Charles and forbade the engagement, prompting his son to refuse to believe him and relinquish his birth-right.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1861, after the outbreak of the Civil War, departed with the 23rd Mississippi Infantry. Major and second-in-command in John (I) Sartoris&rsquo;s regiment, who thoroughly disliked him, in James Longstreet&rsquo;s corps. Following the second battle of Manassas, the regiment elected him as their new leader, promoting him to the rank of Colonel and demoting Sartoris.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1863, his regiment was in Virginia and he got word from Judith of the death of Ellen. He ordered a pair of tombstones from Italy, the best, the finest to be had &mdash; his wife&rsquo;s complete and his with the date left blank: and this while  for all he could know, before his order could be filled or even received he might be already under ground and his grave marked (if at all) by a shattered musket thrust into the earth, or lacking that he might be a second lieutenant or even a private  yet he not only ordered the stones and managed to pay for them, but stranger still he managed to get them past a seacoast so closely blockaded that the incoming runners refused any cargo except ammunition and for the next year the stones were to be a part of the regiment, to follow it into Pennsylvania and be present at Gettysburg, moving behind the regiment in a wagon driven by his body servant through swamp and plain and mountain pass, the regiment moving no faster than the wagon could, with starved gaut men and gaunt spent horses knee deep in icy mud or snow, sweating and cursing it through bog and morass like a piece of artillery, speaking of the two stones as &lsquo;Colonel&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mrs Colonel&rsquo;; then through the Cumberland Gap and down through the Tennessee mountains, travelling at night to dodge Yankee patrols, and into Mississippi in the late fall of &lsquo;64, to Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred, where he put one of the stones over his wife&rsquo;s grave and set the other upright in the hall of the house  and drank  the parched corn coffee and ate the hoe cake which Judith and Clytie prepared for him and kissed Judith on the forehead and said &lsquo;Well, Clytie&rsquo; and returned to the war, all in twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>In March 1865, while retreating through Carolina, confronted Henry again, who had then grudgingly accepted that Charles continued the engagement with Judith. Unable to dissuade Henry, revealed to him that Charles was of mixed race descent, which succeeded in leading Henry to shoot Charles dead upon their return from the war.</p>
<p>Returned home in January 1866, finding Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred destroyed. In March, refused to join Sartoris&rsquo;s group of nightriders which aimed to thwart the organisation of the black vote. In April, became engaged with Ellen&rsquo;s sister Rosa Coldfield, who had come to Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred the previous year, but in June she broke off the engagement and moved back to Jefferson after he proposed that they conceive a child and only marry if it turned out to be a boy.</p>
<p>Attempted to rebuild Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred without help from anyone but had to relinquish most of it, as he realised  that what he had left of it would never support him and his family and so running his little crossroads store with a stock of plowshares and hame strings and calico and kerosene and cheap beads and ribbons and a clientele of freed niggers and white trash.</p>
<p>In 1867 started a relationship with Milly Jones, the fourteen-year-old granddaughter of his associate Wash Jones. On 12 August 1869, she gave birth to an unnamed girl, whereupon Wash Jones killed him with a scythe. Buried by his daughter Judith in the graveyard of Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred.</p>
<p>Proud man, but not a gentleman: didn&rsquo;t want to be one, or even be taken for one. It was said that he not only went out to meet his troubles, he sometimes went out and manufactured them.</p></dd>

Born without eyelids, impotent and allergic to alcohol, which in his own words made him sick to his stomach like a dog. Did not learn to walk and talk until he was four, did not gain hair until five. Injured at age three in a house fire started by his grandmother. Thereafter cared for by doctors and &mdash; in the afternoons and on holidays &mdash; by a foster family, until he was sent to a home for incorrigible children upon cutting up alive first a pair of lovebirds and three months later a kitten. Released after five years of impeccable behaviour. Then moved to Mobile, New Orleans and finally Memphis, telling his mother that he was a night clerk, but in fact becoming rich trafficking liquor.</p>
<p>In the years leading up till 1929 joined Lee Goodwin at Old Frenchman Place, shipping liquor from Goodwin&rsquo;s still back to Memphis.</p>
<p>On 12 May 1929, raped Temple Drake &mdash; who had become marooned at the Old Frenchman Place the previous day &mdash; with a corn cob, and killed Goodwin&rsquo;s associate Tommy, who had attempted to protect her.

                <dd><p>Died February 1865. Former Confederate soldier, leader of a group of 50 to 60 fighters called Grumby&rsquo;s independents that sprang up as soon as Federate forces had left Mississippi. They killed a black man and burned him in his cabin, tortured others and raided smokehouses, stables and houses where they were sure there were no men. Based in an abandoned cotton compress on the Tallahatchie River, sixty miles from the Sartoris Place. They were captured once by a group of old men, on which occasion Grumby produced a tattered raiding commission actually signed by General Forrest; though you couldn&rsquo;t tell if the original name was Grumby or not.</p>
<p>When Rosa Millard, set up by Ab Snopes, came to the cotton compress in December 1864 to try to requisition their four horses with a forged order from General Forrest, after Snopes had already done so himself, he panicked and killed her, but scruples prevented him from also killing fifteen year old Bayard Sartoris (II) and Marengo Strother, as demanded of him by Matt Bowden to cover the first mistake. Between mid December 1864 and late February 1865, the group was chased by Sartoris, Strother and Theophilus McCaslin. In late January or early February, they left behind Ab Snopes to try to pacify them, but only McCaslin, suffering from rheumatism and a shot wound in his arm, abandoned the pursuit. Some days later, Grumby killed an old black man and strung him up as a &lsquo;final&rsquo; warning for Sartoris and Strother that he would not spare them again. In late February, Grumby was betrayed by Bowden, Bridger and other members of his group, who detained both him and Sartoris and Strother, with a pistol each to settle the matter. After failing to kill them, he was himself shot dead by Bayard Sartoris. His body was taken by them to the cotton compress and nailed to its door, his hand to Rosa Millard&rsquo;s grave.</p></dd>

They arrived on a Sunday in June of 1833. Spent the following two years in Sutpen&rsquo;s captivity. Lived on venison cooked over a camp fire, in an unfloored tent made of the wagon hood, and said to initially have been kept at night in a kind of pit  tied wrist to wrist with one of his captor&rsquo;s Carib slaves. In the Summer of 1834, when they had finished all the brick and had the foundations laid and most of the big timbers cut and trimmed, made one unsuccessful attempt to escape into the river bottom, as one day he couldn&rsquo;t stand it anymore or he was afraid he would starve or that the wild niggers (and maybe Colonel Sutpen too) would run out of grub and eat him or maybe he got homesick or maybe he just had to go.  Maybe he had a girl  or maybe he just wanted a girl. Disappeared in broad daylight  in his embroidered vest and Fauntleroy tie and a hat like a Baptist congressman and probably carrying the hat in his hand.  Spent fifty-odd hours of dark and swamp and sleeplessness and fatigue and no grub and nowhere to go and no hope of getting there: just a will to endure and a foreknowing of defeat but not beat yet by a damn sight. Pursued by a search party consisting of Sutpen, his slaves, dogs and a number of neighbours including Jason (II) Lycurgus Compson. Run down in the late afternoon of the third day, more than thirteen miles from the house, in a cave under the river bank, and then only because he had hurt his leg trying to architect himself across the river.</p>
<p>In revenge, designed Sutpen&rsquo;s residence as something like a wing of Versailles glimpsed in a Lilliput’s gothic nightmare. Beginning in 1834, also oversaw the construction of Jefferson&rsquo;s town square, new courthouse and refurbished jail. These were in the simplest Georgian colonial style, since, as he told them, the residents had no money to buy bad taste with nor even anything from which to copy what bad taste might still have been within their compass.</p>
<p>Returned to New Orleans in 1835, when Thomas Sutpen&rsquo;s residence was completed save for the windowglass and the ironware which they could not make by hand, and he had received some compensation from Sutpen.</p></dd>
