                <dd><p>Born September 1849, died c 18 December 1919. Son and middle child of John Sartoris (I) and Mrs Sartoris, brother of Miss Sartoris (I) and Miss Sartoris (II). Father of John Sartoris (II). Born in the same month as Marengo Strother, fed at the same breast (&hellip;) slept together and eaten together. Hunted possom together during Indian Summer nights. And together they shot dead with the family musket the best horse of a Federate troop that passed the Sartoris Place in July 1862. After another regiment burned down the Sartoris Place he traveled with his grandmother Rosa Millard, Marengo Strother and Joby Strother to Alabama in June 1863 to ask for compensation from Colonel Nathaniel Dick, who arranged for a requisition order signed by General Smith for 110 mules, 110 negroes, ten chests and provisions. In the following period, until October 1864, he helped his grandmother with the scheme to acquire 138 more mules through additional, forged requisition orders. After her betrayal by Ab Snopes and murder by Grumby in December 1864, he, Marengo Strother and (initially) Theophilus McCaslin pursued Grumby&rsquo;s group of bandits for over two months. In late February 1865, they were confronted by the bandits, who handed over Grumby with a pistol to settle the matter. After Bayard Sartoris shot him dead, they took his body back to the abandoned cotton compress where he had killed Rosa Millard and nailed it to the door, and brought his hand to her grave in Jefferson. Studied Law in Oxford, lived with Mr Wilkins from 1870 until at least 1873. Enthralled by his father&rsquo;s second wife Drusilla, and the odour of the verbena she would wear. After his father was killed by Ben J Redmond, Bayard confronted him in his office, but refusing to draw his weapon. Redmond fired twice but missed, and then left Jefferson. First Sartoris to reach beyond the age of sixty. Developed a malignant growth on his cheek, which in 1919 was diagnosed as cancer by Dr Alford when at last he consulted him at the insistance of Virginia du Pre. Died in a light car accident a week before Christmas 1919, presumably of heart failure, when his grandson Bayard (III) lost control on the icy road. His last two horses were called Roosevelt and Taft.</p></dd>

Father of an unnamed son with his first wife Caroline, and of Benbow Sartoris with his second wife Narcissa. Started school at seven. At some point schooled in Virginia. Went to England in 1916 to fight as a pilot in WWI. Temporarily returned to teach at a pilot school and to marry Caroline White, who died in labour along with their son. Returned from the war traumatised by the death of his brother John. Nearly died in a car accident on 3 July 1919 but saved by the boy John Henry. On 26 August 1919 married Narcissa Benbow. Had a light car accident a week before Christmas 1919 when he lost control on the icy road, in which his grandfather died of heart failure. Never returned home afterwards. After a week spent in the MacCallum household, set off for a headless trip throughout America that ended when he died on the Dayton Airfield, crash landing an experimental aircraft, on the same day that his son Benbow was born. Did not care about books. In 1919 had a pony called Perry.</p></dd>

<p>Moved to Jefferson in 1839, with slaves and gear and money. In Mexico in 1845, possibly fighting in the Mexican&ndash;American War.</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of the civil war, arranged for his daughters to stay in Memphis and raised with his own funds the 23rd infantery regiments in Mississippi (number two in the roster) that served in James Longstreet&rsquo;s corps. According to Will Falls, his horse Jupiter was the best horse of the Confederacy, but one. The following year, after the second battle of Manassas, he was demoted to the rank of Major by his regiment and replaced by his second-in-command Thomas Sutpen, whom he thoroughly disliked. Amadeus McCaslin and his followers resigned in solidarity and followed him back to Mississippi. Oversaw the making and gathering of a harvest on his plantation, before he got bored and formed with McCaslin and his men an irregular cavalry unit of around one hundred, joining General Forrest in Tennessee. In the summer of 1863 narrowly managed to escape with Jupiter a Federate troop, which had been alerted to his arrival at the Sartoris Place by his slave Lucius Strother. In December 1863, informed his family that he was fighting in Carolina.</p>
<p>Returned to Jefferson in February 1865, together with his comrade-in-arms Drusilla Hawk. Her mother followed her that Spring to demand they marry, being convinced and horrified that she had become his common-law wife. The ceremony was delayed as he shot dead the Brothers Burden to thwart the election of Cassius Q Benbow as Marshall of Jefferson through the participation of black voters, and relocated the polling station to the Sartoris Place and appointed Drusilla as voting commissioner. Following these events, they were driven by Martha Habersham (personally) to the Minister.</p>
<p>Developed the idea for Jefferson&rsquo;s railway, and in 1869, started construction together with the carpetbagger Ben J Redmond and General Jason Lycurgus Compson (II). The latter was bought out following a quarrel. The relationship between Sartoris and Redmond, who had initially been friends, also quickly turned very sour, transforming into a feud, steadily fueled by reminders from Sartoris that Redmond had not fought in the Civil War. While no longer on speaking terms, they managed to agree a second buy-out by Sartoris through the assistance of Judge Benbow. The first engine, which Sartoris named after his younger sister Virginia, ran into Jefferson on 9 August 1872. In August 1873, on the back of the success of the railway, Sartoris defeated Redmond in the election for the state legislature. In October, shot dead by Redmond in what may have been an ambush or a duel where he himself refused to shoot.</p></dd>

Became an unintentional guest at the Old Frenchman Place when on 11 May 1929 Gowan&rsquo;s car broke down; raped there the following day with a corn cob by Popeye Vitelli and witnessed his murder of Tommy, who had tried to protect her. Subsequently taken to Reba Rivers&rsquo;s Memphis brothel. Held there during the next six weeks, forced to have sex with Vitelli&rsquo;s associate Red so Vitelli could watch the act. Fell in love with Red, writing him saucy letters, until Red was shot dead by Vitelli on 17 June when he attempted to visit her in private. Released from captivity by Vitelli to falsely identify Lee Goodwin as her rapist and Tommy&rsquo;s murderer in court on 21 June, leading to his conviction and lynching.</p>
<p>Spent the rest of 1929 in Paris. Married Gowan Stevens that Winter at the American embassy, with a reception at the Crillon and a honeymoon at a rented hideaway built for his European mistress by a Mohammedan prince at Cap Ferrat. Once back in Mississippi, moved into a new bungalow in Jefferson.</p>
<p>Gave birth to their son, Bucky, in early 1931 and took on thereformed dope-fiend Nancy Mannigoe as a nurse to have someone to talk to with similar experiences. Gave birth to a girl in March 1936.</p>
<p>In the Summer of 1936, Red&rsquo;s brother Pete attempted to blackmail her over her letters to Red, but she fell in love with him, writing him more saucy letters. Planned to elope with him on 13 September, unhindered by Mannigoe&rsquo;s attempt to stop her by hiding her valuables and unconvinced by her pleas to remain in order to protect the children. Finally thwarted when, out of desperation, Mannigoe smothered the daughter, sacrificing her for the sake of Bucky.</p>-->

<p>After another troop had burned down the Sartoris place, confiscated their two mules and taken the family silver, he, Bayard Sartoris and Joby Strother accompanied Rosa Millard to Alabama in June 1863 where they obtained a requisition order from General Andrew Jackason Smith for 110 mules, 110 negroes, ten chests and provisions.

At the same time, he helped Rosa Millard with the meticulously controlled distribution of the proceeds to members of the local church. After her betrayal by Ab Snopes and murder by Grumby in December 1864, he, Bayard Sartoris and (initially) Theophilus McCaslin pursued Grumby&rsquo;s group of bandits for over two months.

                <dt id="thomas-sutpen"><a href="#thomas-sutpen">Thomas Sutpen</a></dt>
                <dd><p>Born 1807, West Virginia mountains, died 12 August 1869, Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred. Husband first of Eulalia and later of Ellen Coldfield. Father of Charles Bon (with Eulalia), Clytemnestra (with an unnamed slave), Henry and Judith (with Ellen) and an unnamed girl (with Milly Jones).</p>
<p>Born into a large Methodist family of poor white Scotch-English stock. His mother was a mountain woman, a Scottish woman who .. never did quite learn to speak English.</p>
<p>In 1817, at the age of ten, over the course of perhaps a year, moved with his family down into Tidewater Virginia. Learned the difference not only between white men and black ones, but he was learning that there was a difference between white men and white men not to be measured by lifting anvils or gouging eyes or how much whiskey you could drink then get up and walk out of the room.</p>
<p>At thirteen or fourteen, sent by his father to a one-room country school for about three months one winter, in a room full of children three or four years younger than he and three or four years further advanced. Had not learned to read his own name at the end of the Winter.</p>
<p>Ran away from home in 1820, at fourteen, after being told by a slave to only approach the house of a plantation owner at the back entrance, leaving him unable to fulfill his errant. This set in motion a train of thought culminating in his becoming aware of and thereby losing his innocence, and the realisation that to combat all the human puny mortals under the sun that might lie in hammocks all afternoon with their shoes off, you got to have land and niggers and a fine house to combat them with. Set about for the rest of his life to fulfil this design.</p>
<p>Subsequently embarked as a sailor to the West Indies, to which he had learned in school poor men went in ships and became rich, it didn&rsquo;t matter how, so long as that man was clever and courageous. In the course of the following six years, settled on Haiti, where high mortality was concomitant with the money and the sheen on the dollars was not from gold but from blood, and where he became overseer or foreman or something to a French sugar planter and learned Patois and French.</p>
<p>In 1826 or 1827, broke an eight-day siege of the plantation house by the plantation&rsquo;s slaves when the house ran out of water on the eighth night, but was severely injured in the process. Not able to bear sugar since due to the rank sweet rich smell of the burning fields. Married the planter&rsquo;s daughter Eulalia in 1827, after he had recovered. A virgin until that time. Renounced her and their son, when, upon his birth in 1831, he found out that she had negro blood. Nonetheless chose both a first and a last name for him: Charles Bon.</p>
<p>Seeking some place to hide himself, came to Jefferson on a Sunday in June of 1833, bringing with him twenty to thirty male Caribbean slaves and a captive Parisian architect. Sought the guarantee of reputable men to barricade him from the other and later strangers who might come seeking him in turn, and Jefferson gave him that. In July 1833 contributed the labour of his slaves to the construction of Jefferson&rsquo;s improvised first courthouse.</p>
<p>Initially penniless, obtained money from an unknown source and took land from the Chickasaw nobody knows how, establishing the plantation of Sutpen’s Hundred. Jason Lycurgus Compson (II) lent him the seeds with which he started his plantation, and he became the nearest thing to a friend he ever had in Yoknapatawpha County and this friendship may have helped him to gain a foothold.</p>
<p>Spent the first two years building a big house following the design of his architect. In the Summer of 1834, when they had finished all the brick and had the foundations laid and most of the big timbers cut and trimmed, the architect made one unsuccessful attempt to escape into the river bottom, disappearing in broad daylight.  Led a search party in his pursuit that consisted of his slaves, dogs and a number of neighbours including Jason (II) Lycurgus Compson. Ran down the architect in the late afternoon of the third day, more than thirteen miles from the house.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1834, also let the architect oversee the construction of Jefferson&rsquo;s town square, new courthouse and refurbished jail. Became father of Clytemnestra with a slave in 1834. In 1835, his residence was completed save for the windowglass and the ironware which they could not make by hand, and he paid some compensation to the architect and let him leave.</p>
<p>Then he needed respectability, the shield of a virtuous woman, to make his position impregnable even against the men who had given him protection,  and it was Goodhue Coldfield who gave him that. Married his daughter Ellen Coldfield in June 1838. She came not from one of the local ducal houses but from the lesser baronage whose principality was so far decayed that there would be no risk of his wife bringing him for dowry delusions of grandeur before he should be equipped for it yet not so far decayed but that she might keep them both from getting lost among the new knives and forks and spoons that he had bought Became father of a son Henry with her in 1839 and of a daughter Judith in 1841.</p>
<p>Still invited parties of men for hunting, playing cards, drinking and organised fights between his slaves, in which he himself would occasionally participate at the end of an evening.</p>
<p>By 1848, had got his plantation to running smoothly and had employed as his overseer the son of the same sheriff who had arrested him  on the day of his betrothal. By the time of the Civil War, had become the biggest single landowner and cotton-planter in the county, through a singleminded unflagging effort and utter disregard of for his actions which the town could see might look and how the indicated one&rsquo;s which the town could not see must appear to it. He was not liked (which he evidently did not want anyway) but feared, which seemed to amuse, if not actually please, him.</p>
<p>At Christmas 1859, his son Henry brought home Charles, whom he had become friends with at university, and introduced Judith to Charles, unaware that he was their half-brother. As they entered into an undefined and never-spoken engagement engineered by their mother, he went to New Orleans in June to confirm Charles&rsquo;s identity. At Christmas, he confronted Henry about Charles and forbade the engagement, prompting his son to refuse to believe him and relinquish his birth-right.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1861, after the outbreak of the Civil War, departed with the 23rd Mississippi Infantry. Major and second-in-command in John (I) Sartoris&rsquo;s regiment, who thoroughly disliked him, in James Longstreet&rsquo;s corps. Following the second battle of Manassas, the regiment elected him as their new leader, promoting him to the rank of Colonel and demoting Sartoris.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1863, his regiment was in Virginia and he got word from Judith of the death of Ellen. He ordered a pair of tombstones from Italy, the best, the finest to be had &mdash; his wife&rsquo;s complete and his with the date left blank: and this while  for all he could know, before his order could be filled or even received he might be already under ground and his grave marked (if at all) by a shattered musket thrust into the earth, or lacking that he might be a second lieutenant or even a private  yet he not only ordered the stones and managed to pay for them, but stranger still he managed to get them past a seacoast so closely blockaded that the incoming runners refused any cargo except ammunition and for the next year the stones were to be a part of the regiment, to follow it into Pennsylvania and be present at Gettysburg, moving behind the regiment in a wagon driven by his body servant through swamp and plain and mountain pass, the regiment moving no faster than the wagon could, with starved gaut men and gaunt spent horses knee deep in icy mud or snow, sweating and cursing it through bog and morass like a piece of artillery, speaking of the two stones as &lsquo;Colonel&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mrs Colonel&rsquo;; then through the Cumberland Gap and down through the Tennessee mountains, travelling at night to dodge Yankee patrols, and into Mississippi in the late fall of &lsquo;64, to Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred, where he put one of the stones over his wife&rsquo;s grave and set the other upright in the hall of the house  and drank  the parched corn coffee and ate the hoe cake which Judith and Clytie prepared for him and kissed Judith on the forehead and said &lsquo;Well, Clytie&rsquo; and returned to the war, all in twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>In March 1865, while retreating through Carolina, confronted Henry again, who had then grudgingly accepted that Charles continued the engagement with Judith. Unable to dissuade Henry, revealed to him that Charles was of mixed race descent, which succeeded in leading Henry to shoot Charles dead upon their return from the war.</p>
<p>Returned home in January 1866, finding Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred destroyed. In March, refused to join Sartoris&rsquo;s group of nightriders which aimed to thwart the organisation of the black vote. In April, became engaged with Ellen&rsquo;s sister Rosa Coldfield, who had come to Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred the previous year, but in June she broke off the engagement and moved back to Jefferson after he proposed that they conceive a child and only marry if it turned out to be a boy.</p>
<p>Attempted to rebuild Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred without help from anyone but had to relinquish most of it, as he realised  that what he had left of it would never support him and his family and so running his little crossroads store with a stock of plowshares and hame strings and calico and kerosene and cheap beads and ribbons and a clientele of freed niggers and white trash.</p>
<p>In 1867 started a relationship with Milly Jones, the fourteen-year-old granddaughter of his associate Wash Jones. On 12 August 1869, she gave birth to an unnamed girl, whereupon Wash Jones killed him with a scythe. Buried by his daughter Judith in the graveyard of Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred.</p>
<p>Proud man, but not a gentleman: didn&rsquo;t want to be one, or even be taken for one. It was said that he not only went out to meet his troubles, he sometimes went out and manufactured them.</p></dd>
