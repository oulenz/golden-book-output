                <dd><p>Died 22 June 1929. Moonshiner, common law husband of Ruby Lamar and father of an unnamed boy. Entered a relationship with Ruby before 1915, when he went to the Philippines for a year to serve as a cavalry sergeant. In early 1916, five months before the end of his stay, killed a fellow soldier over a black woman. Sent to Leavenworth upon his return, where he was visited by Ruby every second Sunday, then to World War I France to fight with the infantry, earning two medals, then back to Leavenworth, until his lawyer got a congressman to get him free. Beat up Ruby upon finding out she had paid the lawyer through prostitution. Their plans of formal marriage were forestalled by a lack of funds. At some point (probably before 1915) also served on the Mexican border. Started moonshining at the Old Frenchman Place in 1925, accompanied by Ruby, his father, Tommy, Van and at some point, Memphis gangster Popeye. His and Ruby&rsquo;s son was born in 1928. Arrested for Popeye&rsquo;s murder of Tommy and rape of Temple Drake on 12 May 1929. Defended by Horace Benbow in the subsequent court case, but wrongfully convicted on 21 June after Temple Drake falsely identified him as the perpetrator, and lynched (for Temple&rsquo;s Drake rape, not for Tommy&rsquo;s murder) between 00:30 and 01:00 hrs in the following night, by being burned alive in a vacant lot in an alley next to the jail.</p></dd>

                <dd><p>Born 1899&ndash;1900. Common law wife of Lee Goodwin and mother with him of an unnamed boy. Entered her relationship with Goodwin before he went to the Philippines as a cavalry sergeant in 1915. A previous boyfriend (Frank) was shot by her father after refusing to stop seeing her. When Goodwin went to the Philippines, stayed behind in San Francisco, got a job and lived in a hall room, all the while staying faithful to him. When she found out about the return of his company, had to quit her job to meet him at the harbour, where she found out from another soldier that he had been imprisoned at Leavenworth. Had to get another job for two months to save enough money to join him at Leavenworth, where she lived in a single room for two years, cooking over a gasjet, and worked night shifts at Child&rsquo;s as a waitress so she could see him every other Sunday afternoon. Prostituted herself to a lawyer for two months before finding out that he couldn&rsquo;t do anything for Goodwin, him being a federal prisoner. When Goodwin was sent to fight in World War I France, moved to New York and worked in a munitions plant, &lsquo;staying straight&rsquo;, despite ample romantic opportunities both in the factory and from soldiers returning from the war. When Goodwin was again sent to Leavenworth after the war, prostituted herself to pay for a lawyer to get a congressman to get him released, for this beat up by him. Lack of money prevented their formal marriage. From 1925 until Goodwin&rsquo;s arrest, wrongful conviction and lynching in May and June 1929, went to live at the Old Frenchman Place with him, where he moonshined and she looked after the household, having to walk a mile six times a day to get water, and where she delivered their son in 1928. If she had her way, would hang every man that makes whisky or sells or drinks it, every God&rsquo;s one of them.</p></dd>
