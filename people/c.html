                <dd><p>Born c 1800, Tennessee, died 1864, Jefferson. Brother of Miss Coldfield, husband of Mrs Coldfield, father of Ellen Coldfield Sutpen and Rosa Coldfield.</p>
<p>Married Mrs Coldfield, became father of Ellen in 1817. Moved with his family (including his sister and mother) to Jefferson in 1828, established a small mercantile business. Methodist steward. Neither drank nor hunted nor gambled. Owned neither land nor slaves except two female house servants who came into his possession through a debt and whom he freed as soon as he got them, bought them, putting them on a weekly wage which he held back in full against the discharge of the current market value at which he had assumed them on the debt.</p>
<p>In April 1838, betrothed his daughter Ellen to Thomas Sutpen, apparently moved by his hundred miles of plantation (Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred).</p>
<p>In 1845 his wife gave birth to their daughter Rosa and died in labour.</p>
<p>Opposed the civil war as a conscientious objector on religious grounds. Closed his store and kept it closed all during the period that soldiers were being mobilised and drilled, refused to sell any goods for any price not only to the military but, so it was told, to the families not only of soldiers but of men or women who had supported secession and war only in talk, opinion. Refused to permit his sister to come back home to live while her horse-trader husband was in the army. His two house servants were among the first Jefferson negroes to desert and follow the Yankee troops.</p>
<p>Eventually closed his store permanently. Lived with his daughter Rosa in the back of the house, with the front door locked and the front shutters closed and fastened, and where, so the neighbours said, he spent the day behind one of the slightly opened blinds like a picquet on post, armed not with a musket but with the big family bible  until a detachment of troops would pass: whereupon he would open the bible and declaim in a harsh loud voice even above the sound of the tramping feet, the passages of the old violent vindictive mysticism which he had already marked as the actual picquet would have ranged his row of cartridges along the window sill. Then one morning in 1861 he learned that his store had been broken into and looted, doubtless by a company of strange troops bivouacked on the edge of town and doubtless abetted, if only vocally, by his own fellow citizens. That night he mounted to the attic with his hammer and his handful of nails and nailed the door behind him and threw the hammer out the window. He was not a coward. He was a man of uncompromising moral strength. He was not a coward, even though his consciousness may have objected  not so much to the idea of pouring out human blood and life, but at the idea of waste: of wearing out and eating up and shooting away material in any cause whatever.</p>
<p>Fed by his daughter, who hauled up food at night by means of a well pulley and rope attached to the attic window. Then he died. One morning his hand did not come out to draw up the basket. When his daughter with the help of neighbours broke open the door, they found him  with three days&rsquo; uneaten food beside his pallet bed.</p>
<p>Left neither will nor estate except the house and the rifled shell of the store. So Judge Benbow appointed himself as executor of his estate, assuming responsibility for his daughter Rosa&rsquo;s finances.</p></dd>

                <dd><p>Sister of Goodhue Coldfield. Came with his family to Jefferson in 1928. Reconciled to his daughter Ellen&rsquo;s marriage to Thomas Sutpen by that big house and the notion of slaves underfoot day and night.

Was refused permission by her brother to come home after her husband had gone off to fight in the Civil War.

                <dd><p>Born 1845, Jefferson, died 8 January 1910. Daughter of Goodhue and Mrs Coldfield, sister of Ellen Coldfield Sutpen. Born very late into her parents&rsquo; marriage, her mother dying in labour, for which she never forgave her father. Raised by her spinster aunt Miss Coldfield. had never been taught to do anything practical because the aunt had raised her to believe that she was not only delicate but actually precious</p>
<p>After her father&rsquo;s store was looted, he bolted himself shut in the attic. Now her life consisted of keeping it in herself and her father. She  was cooking the food which as time passed became harder and harder to come by and poorer and poorer in quality, and hauling it up to her father at night by means of a well pully and rope attached to the attic window. She did this for three years, feeding in secret and at night and with food which in quantity was scarcely sufficient for one.</p>
<p>Moved to Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred in June 1865, following the death of her sister and her father, for food and shelter and to fulfil her sister&rsquo;s dying wish that she should look after her (four years elder) niece Judith Sutpen. Became engaged to Thomas Sutpen in April 1866 but broke off the engagement and moved back to her family home in Jefferson in June, after he proposed they conceive a child and only marry if it were a boy. Wore only black thereafter, and nothing under the sun, certainly no man nor committee of men, would ever persuade her to go back to her niece and brother-in-law.</p>
<p>Now Judge Benbow and a group of fellow citizens and neighbors left baskets of food on her doorstep at night, the dishes (the plates containing the food, the napkins which covered it) from which she never washed but returned soiled to the empty basket and set the basket back on the same step where she had found it as if to carry completely out the illusion that it had never existed or at least that she had never touched, emptied, it, had not come out and taken the basket up with that air which had nothing whatever of furtiveness in it nor even defiance, who doubtless tasted the food, criticised its quality or cooking, chewed and swallowed it and felt it digest yet still clung to that delusion, that calm incorrigible insistence that that which all incontrovertible evidence tells her is so does not exist, as women can.</p>
<p>Judge Benbow had appointed himself executor of her father&rsquo;s estate, but that same self deluding  declined to admit that the liquidation of the store had left her something, that she had been left anything but a complete pauper, who would not accept the actual money from the sale of the store from Judge Benbow yet would accept the money&rsquo;s value (and after a few years, over-value) in a dozen ways: would use casual negro boys who happened to pass the house, stopping them and commanding them to rake her yard and they doubtless as aware as the town was that there would be no mention of pay from her, that they would not even see her again though they knew she was watching them from behind the curtains of a window, but that Judge Benbow would pay them &mdash; would enter the stores and command objects from the shelves and showcases  and walk out of the store with them &mdash; who with the same aberrant cunning which would not wash the dishes and napkins from the baskets declined to have any discussion of her affairs with Benbow since she must have known that the sums which she had received from him must have years ago over-balanced  whatever the store had brought.</p>
<p>Already in the first year of her father&rsquo;s voluntary incarceration,  dated at two oclock in the morning, she had written the first of her odes to Southern soldiers. After the war, she established herself as the town&rsquo;s and the county&rsquo;s poetess laureate by issuing to the stern and meager subscription list of the county newspaper poems, ode, eulogy, and epitaph, out of some bitter and implacable reserve of undefeat. By 1885, her portfolio contained a thousand or more pieces.</p>
<p>After her niece Judith Sutpen died in 1884, she commanded a two hundred dollar headstone from Judge Benbow.</p>
<p>Refused at the last to be a ghost. Visited Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred in September 1909 with Quentin (III) Compson to find that Henry had returned and was hiding there. Returned with an ambulance around Christmas, upon which Clytemnestra set fire to the house, killing herself and Henry. Had to be transported back in the ambulance herself, subsequently entering a coma. Died almost two weeks later, 8 January 1910. Buried the next day.</p></dd>

                <dt id="candace-compson-head"><a href="#candace-compson-head">Candace Compson Head</a></dt>
                <dd><p><em>Caddy</em>. Born 1891&ndash;92, died after 1943. Second-oldest child of Jason (III) and Caroline Compson, mother of Quentin (IV). Doomed and knew it, accepted the doom without either seeking or fleeing it. Loved her brother Quentin (III) despite him, loved not only him but loved in him that bitter prophet and inflexible corruptless judge of what he considered the family &lsquo;s honor and its doom, as he thought he loved but really hated in her what he considered the frail doomed vessel of its pride and the foul instrument of its disgrace, not only this, she loved him not only in spite of but because of the fact that he himself was incapable of love, accepting the fact that he must value above all not her but the virginity of which she was custodian and on which she placed no value whatever: the frail physical stricture which to her was no more than a hangnail would have been. Knew the brother loved death best of all and was not jealous, would (and perhaps in the calculation and deliberation of her marriage did) have handed him the hypothetical hemlock.</p>
<p>Had several boyfriends, including Dalton Ames, who may have been the father of Quentin (IV), which regardless of what its sex would be she had already named after the brother whom they both (she and her brother) knew was already the same as dead. Married Sydney Herbert Head on 25 April 1910, whom she and her mother had met while vacationing at French Lick the summer before and who gifted her the first car in Jefferson. Already two months pregnant of Quentin (IV) at that point and therefore felt she got to marry someone. Divorced by Herbert Head in 1911, likely because he discovered Quentin (IV) was not his. Entrusted her into the care of her mother and her brother Jason Compson (IV), and departed by the next train. Sent money to Jason (IV) each month for her daughter&rsquo;s upbringing, who kept it for himself and who generally prevented her from seeing Quentin (IV) again. Seemingly prostituted herself for some time. Not invited to her father&rsquo;s funeral, but attended it incognito after reading about it in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Remarried 1920 to a minor movingpicture magnate, Hollywood California. Divorced by mutual agreement, Mexico 1925. Vanished in Paris with the German occupation, 1940, still beautiful and probably still wealthy too since she did not look within fifteen years of her actual fortyeight, whereafter she was not seen or heard of again, except by her high school class mate Melissa Meek, who in 1943 recognised her in a picture, a photograph in color clipped obviously from a slick magazine—a picture filled with luxury and money and sunlight—a Cannebière backdrop of mountains and palms and cypresses and the sea, an open powerful expensive chromium/rimmed sports car, the woman&rsquo;s face hatless between a rich scarf and a seal coat, ageless and beautiful, cold serene and damned; beside her a handsome lean man of middleage in the ribbons and tabs of a German staffgeneral.</p></dd>

Entrusted her into the care of her mother and her brother Jason Compson (IV), and departed by the next train. Sent money to Jason (IV) each month for her daughter&rsquo;s upbringing, who kept it for himself and who generally prevented her from seeing Quentin (IV) again. Seemingly prostituted herself for some time. Not invited to her father&rsquo;s funeral, but attended it incognito after reading about it in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Remarried 1920 to a minor movingpicture magnate, Hollywood California. Divorced by mutual agreement, Mexico 1925. Vanished in Paris with the German occupation, 1940, still beautiful and probably still wealthy too since she did not look within fifteen years of her actual fortyeight, whereafter she was not seen or heard of again, except by her high school class mate Melissa Meek, who in 1943 recognised her in a picture, a photograph in color clipped obviously from a slick magazine—a picture filled with luxury and money and sunlight—a Cannebière backdrop of mountains and palms and cypresses and the sea, an open powerful expensive chromium/rimmed sports car, the woman&rsquo;s face hatless between a rich scarf and a seal coat, ageless and beautiful, cold serene and damned; beside her a handsome lean man of middleage in the ribbons and tabs of a German staffgeneral.</p>-->

                <dd><p>Born 1892&ndash;94. Youngest-but-one son of Jason (III) and Caroline Compson.</p>
<p>After his parents had sold off part of the Compson place to pay for his sister Candace&rsquo;s (failed) marriage to Sydney Head and his brother Quentin (III)&rsquo;s first year at Harvard (which ended in suicide), used his own niggard savings out of his meagre wages as a storeclerk to send himself to a Memphis school where he learned to class and grade cotton. Started working in Earl Triplett&rsquo;s farmers&rsquo; supply store in Jefferson in 1916. Begrudged Candace and her daughter Quentin (IV) missing out on a position at Sydney Head&rsquo;s bank that he had been promised, since Sydney Head probably divorced Candace because he discovered Quentin (IV) was not his. Kept for himself the 200 dollar sent each month by Candace for her daughter Quentin (IV), replacing the cheque with a fake one for their mother to burn, and banking the real cheques as his salary on his mother&rsquo;s account, whom they were made out to and over whom he had power of attorney. His actual salary may have been 160 dollar a month. Used the 1000 dollar his mother invested for him in Earl Triplett&rsquo;s business to buy himself a car. Had regular headaches, which his mother believed were caused by the gasoline of the car.</p>
<p>The first sane Compson since before Culloden and (a childless bachelor) hence the last. Logical rational contained and even a philosopher in the old stoic tradition: thinking nothing whatever of God one way or the other and simply considering the police and so fearing and respecting only the Negro woman, his sworn enemy since his birth and his mortal one since that day in 1911 when she Dilsey Gibson too divined by simple clairvoyance that he was somehow using his infant niece Quentin IV&rsquo;s illegitimacy to blackmail its mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Following his dipsomaniac father&rsquo;s death, he assumed the entire burden of the rotting family in the rotting house, supporting his idiot brother Maury Compson because of their mother, sacrificing what pleasures might have been the right and just due and even the necessity of a thirty-year-old bachelor, so that his mother&rsquo;s life might continue as nearly as possible to what it had been this not because he loved her but (a sane man always) simply because he was afraid of the Negro cook Dilsey Gibson whom he could not even force to leave even when he tried to stop paying her weekly wages.</p>
<p>After his brother Maury touched a passing schoolgirl outside the fence delimiting the Compson Place, had himself appointed the idiot&rsquo;s guardian without letting their mother know and had it castrated before their mother even knew it was out of the house.</p>
<p>Not only fended off end held his own with Compsons but competed and held his own with the Snopeses who took over the little town Jefferson following the turn of the century as the Compsons and Sartorises and their ilk faded from it. Managed to save almost three thousand dollars ($2840.50)  in niggard and agonised dimes and quarters and halfdollars, which hoard he kept in no bank because to him a banker too was just one more Compson, but hid in a locked bureau drawer in his bedroom whose bed he made and changed himself since he kept the bedroom door locked all the time save when he was passing through it. To him all the rest of the town and the world and the human race too except himself were Compsons, inexplicable yet quite predictable in that they were in no sense whatever to be trusted.</p>
<p>On 7 April 1928, his niece Quentin (IV) broke into his room through the window and took off with his savings. He unsuccessfully pursued her to Mottson. The amount she stole was not $2840.50, it was almost seven thousand dollars and this was Jason&rsquo;s rage, the red unbearable fury which on that night and at intervals recurring with little or no diminishment for the next five years, made him seriously believe would at some unwarned instant destroy him, kill him as instantaneously dead as a bullet or a lightningbolt: that although he had been robbed not of a mere petty three thousand dollars but of almost seven thousand he couldn&rsquo;t even tell anybody; because he had been robbed of seven thousand dollars instead of just three he could not only never receive justification &mdash; he did not want sympathy &mdash; from other men unlucky enough to have one bitch for a sister and another for a niece, he couldn&rsquo;t even go to the police; because he had lost four thousand dollars which did not belong to him he couldn&rsquo;t even recover the three thousand which did since those first four thousand dollars were not only the legal property of his niece as a part of the money supplied for her support and maintenance by her mother over the last sixteen years, they did not exist at all, having been officially recorded as expended and consumed in the annual reports he submitted to the district Chancellor, as required of him as guardian and trustee by his bondsmen: so that he had been robbed not only of his thievings but his savings too, and by his own victim; he had been robbed not only of the four thousand dollars which he had risked jail to acquire but of the three thousand which he had hoarded at the price of sacrifice and denial, almost a nickel and a dime at a time, over a period of almost twenty years: and this not only by his own victim but by a child who did it at one blow, without premeditation or plan, not even knowing or even caring how much she would find when she broke the drawer open; and now he couldn&rsquo;t even go to the police for help: he who had considered the police always, never given them any trouble, had paid the taxes for years which supported them in parasitic and sadistic idleness; not only that, he didn&rsquo;t dare pursue the girl himself because he might catch her and she would talk, so that his only recourse was a vain dream which kept him tossing and sweating on nights two and three and even four years after the event, when he should have forgotten about it: of catching her without warning, springing on her out of the dark, before she had spent all the money, and murder her before she had time to open her mouth.</p>
<p>Probably between 1928 and 1933, he took over the farmers&rsquo; supply store from Earl Triplett.</p>
<p>After the death of his mother in 1933 he (no Snopes, but Jason Compson himself) committed his brother Maury to the state asylum in Jackson and vacated the Compson Place, first chopping up the vast oncesplendid rooms into what he called apartments and selling the whole thing to a countryman who opened a boardinghouse in it. Thus he was able to free himself forever not only from the idiot brother and the house but from the Negro woman too, moving into a pair of offices up a flight of stairs above the supplystore containing his cotton ledgers and samples, which he had converted into a bedroom-kitchen-bath, in and out of which on weekends there would be seen a big plain friendly brazenhaired pleasantfaced woman Lorraine no longer very young, in round picture hats and (in its season) an imitation fur coat, the two of them, the middleaged cottonbuyer and the woman whom the town called, simply, his friend from Memphis, seen at the local picture show on Saturday night and on Sunday morning mounting the apartment stairs with paper bags from the grocer&rsquo;s containing loaves and eggs and oranges and cans of soup, domestic, uxorious, connubial, until the late afternoon bus carried her back to Memphis. He was emancipated now. He was free. &lsquo;In 1865,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;Abe Lincoln freed the niggers from the Compsons. In 1933, Jason Compson freed the Compsons from the niggers.&rsquo;</p></dd>

The amount she stole was not $2840.50, it was almost seven thousand dollars and this was Jason&rsquo;s rage, the red unbearable fury which on that night and at intervals recurring with little or no diminishment for the next five years, made him seriously believe would at some unwarned instant destroy him, kill him as instantaneously dead as a bullet or a lightningbolt: that although he had been robbed not of a mere petty three thousand dollars but of almost seven thousand he couldn&rsquo;t even tell anybody; because he had been robbed of seven thousand dollars instead of just three he could not only never receive justification &mdash; he did not want sympathy &mdash; from other men unlucky enough to have one bitch for a sister and another for a niece, he couldn&rsquo;t even go to the police; because he had lost four thousand dollars which did not belong to him he couldn&rsquo;t even recover the three thousand which did since those first four thousand dollars were not only the legal property of his niece as a part of the money supplied for her support and maintenance by her mother over the last sixteen years, they did not exist at all, having been officially recorded as expended and consumed in the annual reports he submitted to the district Chancellor, as required of him as guardian and trustee by his bondsmen: so that he had been robbed not only of his thievings but his savings too, and by his own victim; he had been robbed not only of the four thousand dollars which he had risked jail to acquire but of the three thousand which he had hoarded at the price of sacrifice and denial, almost a nickel and a dime at a time, over a period of almost twenty years: and this not only by his own victim but by a child who did it at one blow, without premeditation or plan, not even knowing or even caring how much she would find when she broke the drawer open; and now he couldn&rsquo;t even go to the police for help: he who had considered the police always, never given them any trouble, had paid the taxes for years which supported them in parasitic and sadistic idleness; not only that, he didn&rsquo;t dare pursue the girl himself because he might catch her and she would talk, so that his only recourse was a vain dream which kept him tossing and sweating on nights two and three and even four years after the event, when he should have forgotten about it: of catching her without warning, springing on her out of the dark, before she had spent all the money, and murder her before she had time to open her mouth.</p>
<p>Probably between 1928 and 1933, he took over the farmers&rsquo; supply store from Earl Triplett.</p>
<p>After the death of his mother in 1933 he (no Snopes, but Jason Compson himself) committed his brother Maury to the state asylum in Jackson and vacated the Compson Place, first chopping up the vast oncesplendid rooms into what he called apartments and selling the whole thing to a countryman who opened a boardinghouse in it. Thus he was able to free himself forever not only from the idiot brother and the house but from the Negro woman too, moving into a pair of offices up a flight of stairs above the supplystore containing his cotton ledgers and samples, which he had converted into a bedroom-kitchen-bath, in and out of which on weekends there would be seen a big plain friendly brazenhaired pleasantfaced woman Lorraine no longer very young, in round picture hats and (in its season) an imitation fur coat, the two of them, the middleaged cottonbuyer and the woman whom the town called, simply, his friend from Memphis, seen at the local picture show on Saturday night and on Sunday morning mounting the apartment stairs with paper bags from the grocer&rsquo;s containing loaves and eggs and oranges and cans of soup, domestic, uxorious, connubial, until the late afternoon bus carried her back to Memphis. He was emancipated now. He was free. &lsquo;In 1865,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;Abe Lincoln freed the niggers from the Compsons. In 1933, Jason Compson freed the Compsons from the niggers.&rsquo;</p>-->

                <dd><p><em>Benjy</em>. Born 7 April 1895. Youngest son of Caroline and Jason Compton III. Mentally handicapped. Originally named after his maternal uncle Maury Bascomb, but rechristened <em>Benjamin</em> by his brother Quentin (Benjamin, our lastborn, sold into Egypt)  at age five (in November 1900) when at last even his mother realised what he was and insisted weeping that his name must be changed. Stopped sleeping in the same bed as his sister Candace at age 13. Castrated in 1913 for going through the gate of the Compson place one day and touching a passing school girl. Attended successively by Versh Gibson, T.P. Gibson and Luster.</p>
<p>Loved three things: the pasture which was sold to pay for Candace&rsquo;s wedding and to send Quentin to Harvard, his sister Candace, firelight. Who lost none of them because he could not remember his sister but only the loss of her, and firelight was the same bright shape as going to sleep, and the pasture was even better sold than before because now he and TP could not only follow timeless along the fence the motions which it did not even matter to him were humanbeings swinging golfsticks, TP could lead them to clumps of grass or weeds where there would appear suddenly in TP&rsquo;s hand small white spherules which competed with and even conquered what he did not even know was gravity and all the immutable laws when released from the hand toward plank floor or smokehouse wall or concrete sidewalk.</p>
<p>Committed to the state asylum in Jackson by his brother Jason (IV) after the death of their mother Caroline in 1933. Lost nothing then either because, as with his sister, he remembered not the pasture but only its loss, and firelight was still the same bright shape of sleep. tSatF</p></dd>
