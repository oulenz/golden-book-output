In Europe between December 1917 and April 1919 as part of the YMCA. Learned the art of glass blowing in Venice which he continued to practice after returning home. Married Belle Mitchell in early 1920, with whom he had already maintained an affair since 1917, and with whom and whose daughter he moved to Kinston, first into a rented house, then 1922 into a bungalow he built for them. Also briefly in an affair with Belle&rsquo;s sister Joan Heppleton in December 1919. Mortgaged his Kinston house so that he could keep the family home in Jefferson and his sister would not need to rent it out.</p>
<p>Temporarily left Belle sometime in 1924&ndash;25, then stayed with her until he again decided to quit her on 3 May 1929, because he felt the dripping of the package of shrimps (whose smell even after ten years he couldn&rsquo;t stand) he collected from the station for Belle every Friday summed up his existence. On his way to his sister, forced to spend the evening of 7 May at the Old Frenchman Place, following a chance encounter with Popeye. After Popeye&rsquo;s murder of Tommy and rape of Temple Drake, and against the express wish of his sister, provided a measure of accomodation for Ruby Goodwin and her infant son and unsuccessfully acted as defence attorney for her common law husband Lee Goodwin, who on 21 June was convicted for Popeye&rsquo;s crimes and subsequently lynched.

                <dt id="charles-(i)-bon"><a href="#charles-(i)-bon">Charles (I) Bon</a></dt>
                <dd><p>Born November or December 1831, Haiti, died 3 May 1865, Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred. Only child of Thomas and Eulalia Sutpen, father of Charles (II) Bon. His father repudiated him and his mother upon finding out at his birth that they had negro blood. Nonetheless named by his father, including his last name, which was not that of his mother.</p>
<p>Moved to New Orleans with his mother. Spent large chunks of his mother&rsquo;s fortune on his horses and clothes and the champagne and gambling and women. Had more watches and cuff buttons and finer linen and horses and yellow-wheeled buggies (not to mention the gals) than most others did. Married an octoroon woman with whom in 1859 he had a son, Charles (II).</p>
<p>In September of that year, started reading law at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where he met his half-brother Henry Sutpen, who, unaware of their being related, invited him to Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred over Christmas and introduced him to their sister Judith Sutpen. Over the course of the following year, 1860, entered into an undefined and never-spoken second engagement with Judith, engineered by her mother Ellen. Refused to explicitly make a proposal of marriage not because he suspected Judith was his half-sister, but because he was more interested in receiving a sign &mdash; any sign &mdash; by his father that he recognised him. He again visited Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred in June, at which time his father had traveled to New Orleans to confirm his identity. The following Christmas eve, his father revealed his identity to Henry, who at first refused to believe and repudiated his birth-right.</p>
<p>Thereupon he followed Henry to New Orleans, riding through the bright cold of that Christmas day to the River, from where they took the steamboat. There would be Christmas on the boat too: the same holly and mistletoe, the same eggnog and toddy; perhaps, doubtless, a Christmas supper and a ball, but not for them: the two of them in the dark and the cold standing at the guard rail above the dark water and still not talking since there was nothing to say. In New Orleans, explained to Henry that he would only break off the engagement if his father would confront himself.</p>
<p>Hoping that the war would resolve the matter by killing either of them, in the spring of 1861 they returned north, into Mississippi and secretely enrolled as privates in the University Grays Company of the 11th Mississippi Infantry, hiding until they could join the company after its departure in June. Received a lieutenancy before the company entered its first engagement even. In April 1862, either he or Henry was shot through the shoulder during the battle of Shiloh at Pittsburg Landing, carried to safety by the other on his shoulders, and recovered in a private house in Corinth.</p>
<p>During those four years, suspended his decision and did not contact Judith. Then finally, in March 1865, while retreating through Carolina, crossed paths with Thomas Sutpen and believed to see recognition in his gaze, and wrote a letter to Judith.

                <!--<p class="first-par"><h3><a href="#charles-(i)-bon">Charles (I) Bon</a></h3>  Born November or December 1831, Haiti, died 3 May 1865, Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred. Only child of Thomas and Eulalia Sutpen, father of Charles (II) Bon. His father repudiated him and his mother upon finding out at his birth that they had negro blood. Nonetheless named by his father, including his last name, which was not that of his mother.</p>
<p>Moved to New Orleans with his mother. Spent large chunks of his mother&rsquo;s fortune on his horses and clothes and the champagne and gambling and women. Had more watches and cuff buttons and finer linen and horses and yellow-wheeled buggies (not to mention the gals) than most others did. Married an octoroon woman with whom in 1859 he had a son, Charles (II).</p>
<p>In September of that year, started reading law at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where he met his half-brother Henry Sutpen, who, unaware of their being related, invited him to Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred over Christmas and introduced him to their sister Judith Sutpen. Over the course of the following year, 1860, entered into an undefined and never-spoken second engagement with Judith, engineered by her mother Ellen. Refused to explicitly make a proposal of marriage not because he suspected Judith was his half-sister, but because he was more interested in receiving a sign &mdash; any sign &mdash; by his father that he recognised him. He again visited Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred in June, at which time his father had traveled to New Orleans to confirm his identity. The following Christmas eve, his father revealed his identity to Henry, who at first refused to believe and repudiated his birth-right.</p>
<p>Thereupon he followed Henry to New Orleans, riding through the bright cold of that Christmas day to the River, from where they took the steamboat. There would be Christmas on the boat too: the same holly and mistletoe, the same eggnog and toddy; perhaps, doubtless, a Christmas supper and a ball, but not for them: the two of them in the dark and the cold standing at the guard rail above the dark water and still not talking since there was nothing to say. In New Orleans, explained to Henry that he would only break off the engagement if his father would confront himself.</p>
<p>Hoping that the war would resolve the matter by killing either of them, in the spring of 1861 they returned north, into Mississippi and secretely enrolled as privates in the University Grays Company of the 11th Mississippi Infantry, hiding until they could join the company after its departure in June. Received a lieutenancy before the company entered its first engagement even. In April 1862, either he or Henry was shot through the shoulder during the battle of Shiloh at Pittsburg Landing, carried to safety by the other on his shoulders, and recovered in a private house in Corinth.</p>
<p>During those four years, suspended his decision and did not contact Judith. Then finally, in March 1865, while retreating through Carolina, crossed paths with Thomas Sutpen and believed to see recognition in his gaze, and wrote a letter to Judith. Initially met acquiescence with Henry, then renewed refusal after Henry was told by his father that he was of mixed race descent. Henry still refused to stop him with force, until finally on 3 May 1865, Henry shot him dead at the gates of Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred upon their return from the war.</p>
<p>After his body was brought into the house, Judith took from his pocket the metal case she had given him with her picture in it, which he may have swapped for the picture of his octoroon wife to convey <em>I was no good; do not grieve for me</em>.

<p>In December 1871, upon the disappearance of his mother, was brought to Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred by his half-aunt Clytemnestra Sutpen. In 1879 was indicted by Jim Hamblett for badly injuring a man at a negro ball held in a cabin a few miles from Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred. The case was quashed by Jason Lycurgus Compson (II), who paid his fine and gave him money to move away to be whatever he wanted among strangers. Married a full-blood negress, name unknown, 1879. Spent the following year on his back recovering from the last mauling he had received, in frowsy stinking rooms  broken by other periods, intervals, of furious and incomprehensible and apparently reasonless moving  apparently hunting out situations in order to flaunt and fling the ape-like body of his charcoal companion in the faces of all and any who would retaliate  giving the first blow, usually unarmed and heedless of the numbers opposed to him.</p>
<p>In 1880 returned to Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred, so severely beaten and mauled that he could not even hold himself on the spavined and saddleless mule on which he rode while his wife walked besides it to keep him from falling off. Rented a parcel of land off of Judith Sutpen and rebuilt a dilapidated slave cabin. Farmed on shares a portion of the Sutpen plantation, farmed it pretty well, with solitary and steady husbandry within his physical limitations, the body and limbs which still looked too light for the task which he had set himself, who lived like a hermit in the cabin,  who consorted with neither white nor black  and who was not seen in Jefferson but three times during the next four years and then to appear, be reported by the negroes  as being either blind or violently drunk in the negro store district on Depot Street, where Jason (II) Lycurgus Compson would come and take him away (or if he were too drunk, had become violent, the town officers). In 1881, their son Jim Bond was born.</p>
<p>Contracted yellow fever around January 1884. Nursed by Judith Sutpen in the main building of Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred until she also fell ill. Survived her but died later that year. Fifth person to be buried in the graveyard of Sutpen&rsquo;s Hundred. His headstone had already been arranged for by Judith when he was brought from New Orleans by Clytemnestra, and during the twelve years after his death, Clytemnestra scrimped and saved the money to pay off the remaining debt to Jason (II) Lycurgus Compson.</p></dd>
