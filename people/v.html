                <dd><p>Born 25 December 1900, Pensacola, died August 1929, Birmingham. Born without eyelids, impotent and allergic to alcohol, which in his own words made him sick to his stomach like a dog. Did not learn to walk and talk until he was four, did not gain hair until five. Injured at age three in a house fire started by his grandmother. Thereafter cared for by doctors and &mdash; in the afternoons and on holidays &mdash; by a foster family, until he was sent to a home for incorrigible children upon cutting up alive first a pair of lovebirds and three months later a kitten. Released after five years of impeccable behaviour. Then moved to Mobile, New Orleans and finally Memphis, telling his mother that he was a night clerk, but in fact becoming rich trafficking liquor.</p>
<p>In the years leading up till 1929 joined Lee Goodwin at Old Frenchman Place, shipping liquor from Goodwin&rsquo;s still back to Memphis.</p>
<p>On 12 May 1929, raped Temple Drake &mdash; who had become marooned at the Old Frenchman Place the previous day &mdash; with a corn cob, and killed Goodwin&rsquo;s associate Tommy, who had attempted to protect her. Subsequently detained her in Reba Rivers&rsquo;s Memphis brothel, repeatedly pimping her to Red, a bouncer at his night club, himself watching the act. Killed Red on 17 June in Joe&rsquo;s dancing venue. Arrested in Birmingham, on his way to his mother, for the unrelated murder of a policeman in an Alabama village also on 17 June. Wrongfully convicted and hanged in August.</p>
