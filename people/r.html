During the Civil War, followed the Northern army to Memphis in 1861, forewent personal profit. In 1864, came to Jefferson with the Brigadier commanding the Federal troops and decided to stay there. Major sponsor of Jefferson&rsquo;s reconstruction.</p>
<p>Partnered with John Sartoris (I) (and a third person that no one would remember) to build Jefferson&rsquo;s railway in 1869. Although the two had originally been friends, their relationship quickly turned very sour, transforming into a feud, steadily fueled by reminders from Sartoris that Redmond had not fought in the Civil War. While no longer on speaking terms, they managed to agree a buy-out by Sartoris through the assistance of Judge Benbow. In August 1873, defeated by Sartoris in the election for the state legislature, backed by the success of the railway. In October that year, killed Sartoris in a duel (Sartoris did not shoot). The following day, was confronted by John&rsquo;s son Bayard Sartoris (II) who did not shoot either, but this time Redmond missed. Left his office, went to the train station and took the southbound train and left Mississippi, never to return to Jefferson.</p></dd>
