                <dd><p>Died February 1865. Former Confederate soldier, leader of a group of 50 to 60 fighters called Grumby&rsquo;s independents that sprang up as soon as Federate forces had left Mississippi. They killed a black man and burned him in his cabin, tortured others and raided smokehouses, stables and houses where they were sure there were no men. Based in an abandoned cotton compress on the Tallahatchie River, sixty miles from the Sartoris Place. They were captured once by a group of old men, on which occasion Grumby produced a tattered raiding commission actually signed by General Forrest; though you couldn&rsquo;t tell if the original name was Grumby or not.</p>
<p>When Rosa Millard, set up by Ab Snopes, came to the cotton compress in December 1864 to try to requisition their four horses with a forged order from General Forrest, after Snopes had already done so himself, he panicked and killed her, but scruples prevented him from also killing fifteen year old Bayard Sartoris (II) and Marengo Strother, as demanded of him by Matt Bowden to cover the first mistake. Between mid December 1864 and late February 1865, the group was chased by Sartoris, Strother and Theophilus McCaslin. In late January or early February, they left behind Ab Snopes to try to pacify them, but only McCaslin, suffering from rheumatism and a shot wound in his arm, abandoned the pursuit. Some days later, Grumby killed an old black man and strung him up as a &lsquo;final&rsquo; warning for Sartoris and Strother that he would not spare them again. In late February, Grumby was betrayed by Bowden, Bridger and other members of his group, who detained both him and Sartoris and Strother, with a pistol each to settle the matter. After failing to kill them, he was himself shot dead by Bayard Sartoris. His body was taken by them to the cotton compress and nailed to its door, his hand to Rosa Millard&rsquo;s grave.</p></dd>
