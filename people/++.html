                <dd><p>Born Paris. Very short. Lived in Martinique for a while, from where he was coaxed by Thomas Sutpen to come with him to Yoknapatawpha County to construct his plantation house. They arrived on a Sunday in June of 1833. Spent the following two years in Sutpen&rsquo;s captivity. Lived on venison cooked over a camp fire, in an unfloored tent made of the wagon hood, and said to initially have been kept at night in a kind of pit  tied wrist to wrist with one of his captor&rsquo;s Carib slaves. In the Summer of 1834, when they had finished all the brick and had the foundations laid and most of the big timbers cut and trimmed, made one unsuccessful attempt to escape into the river bottom, as one day he couldn&rsquo;t stand it anymore or he was afraid he would starve or that the wild niggers (and maybe Colonel Sutpen too) would run out of grub and eat him or maybe he got homesick or maybe he just had to go.  Maybe he had a girl  or maybe he just wanted a girl. Disappeared in broad daylight  in his embroidered vest and Fauntleroy tie and a hat like a Baptist congressman and probably carrying the hat in his hand.  Spent fifty-odd hours of dark and swamp and sleeplessness and fatigue and no grub and nowhere to go and no hope of getting there: just a will to endure and a foreknowing of defeat but not beat yet by a damn sight. Pursued by a search party consisting of Sutpen, his slaves, dogs and a number of neighbours including Jason (II) Lycurgus Compson. Run down in the late afternoon of the third day, more than thirteen miles from the house, in a cave under the river bank, and then only because he had hurt his leg trying to architect himself across the river.</p>
<p>In revenge, designed Sutpen&rsquo;s residence as something like a wing of Versailles glimpsed in a Lilliput’s gothic nightmare. Beginning in 1834, also oversaw the construction of Jefferson&rsquo;s town square, new courthouse and refurbished jail. These were in the simplest Georgian colonial style, since, as he told them, the residents had no money to buy bad taste with nor even anything from which to copy what bad taste might still have been within their compass.</p>
<p>Returned to New Orleans in 1835, when Thomas Sutpen&rsquo;s residence was completed save for the windowglass and the ironware which they could not make by hand, and he had received some compensation from Sutpen.</p></dd>
