                <dd><p>Born c 1840. Husband of Mrs Peabody, father of Lucius (II) Peabody. Doctor with a legendary reputation. The fattest man in Yoknapatawpha county, weighing three hundred and ten pounds and possessing a digestive tract like a horse. Filled the room with his bluff and homely humanity, and when he crossed the floor  the whole building trembled to his tread.</p>
<p>Practiced medicine in Yoknapatawpha county when a doctor’s equipment consisted of a saw and a gallon of whisky and a satchel of calomel; he had been John (I) Sartoris’ regimental surgeon, and up to the day of the automobile he would start out at any hour of the twenty-four in any weather and for any distance, over practically impassable roads in a lopsided buckboard to visit anyone, white or black, who sent for him. Never worried a fellow before he was ready to pay; accepting for fee usually a meal of corn pone and coffee or perhaps a small measure of corn or fruit, or a few flower bulbs or graftings. When he was young and hasty he had kept a daybook, kept it meticulously until these hypothetical assets totalled $10,000.00. But that was in 1880, and since then he hadn’t bothered with a record at all; and later from time to time a countryman entered his shabby office and discharged an obligation, commemorating sometimes the payor’s entry into the world, incurred by his father or grandfather and which Dr Peabody himself had long since forgotten about. Every one in the county knew him and sent him hams and wild game at Christmas, and it was said that he could spend the balance of his days driving about the county in the buckboard he still used, with never a thought for board and lodging and without the expenditure of a penny for either.</p>
<p>Starting after the Civil War, partook in Thanksgiving and Christmas meals at the Sartoris Place. Claimed to have proposed to Virginia du Pre in the Sartoris garden in the spring of 1969, on John (I) Sartoris’ account because he was having more trouble than he could stand with politics outside his home, and pretty near had her persuaded for a while.</p>
<p>Courted his eventual wife for fourteen years before he was able to marry her. The courtship was during the days when he physicked and amputated the whole county by buckboard; often after a year’s separation he would drive forty miles to see her, to be intercepted on the way and deflected to a childbed or a mangled limb, with only a scribbled message to assuage the interval of another year. Their only child was born in 1890.</p>
<p>Amputated the leg of Mr Suratt.</p>
<p>By 1919, had six or seven black servants, and more unregistered ones. His library consisted of a stack of lurid paper covered nickel novels, slowly gathering successive layers of dust, and he passed his office hours on the sofa, reading them over and over.</p>
<p>Was still traversing the county to visit patients in 1927, attending to Addie Bundren as she lay dying. Reckoned he must reach the fifty-thousand dollar mark of dead accounts on his books before he could quit.</p></dd>
